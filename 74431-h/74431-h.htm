<p class="noindent">The paper which follows was written by me in 1965.
It was originally intended to serve as an in-house
guide for Plantation staff to use when explaining Wampanoag
culture to visitors. The absence of any other
comprehensive treatment of Plymouth’s aboriginal population
has made the paper an item much in demand
by Plantation staff, visitors, and members of the
academic community. Hopefully its publication in the
OCCASIONAL PAPERS series will make this ethnographic

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</h2>

<p class="noindent">by Dr. Alex F. Ricciardelli, Director of the Haffenreffer
Museum of Anthropology and Associate Professor
of Anthropology at Brown University.</p>


<p class="p1">This monograph represents the only extensive
ethnography we have of the Wampanoag Indians and
provides us with the best understanding available of
Massasoit and his people at the time they occupied
the coastal areas of southern New England. The author
has consulted all the known historical sources and
arranged the material into a series of topical categories
which will serve as a handy reference to the literature.
Useful also are the author’s comments regarding those
parts of Wampanoag culture about which we presently
have no knowledge.</p>

<p>Southern New England has been one of the
neglected areas in the anthropology of North America.
This seems strange when one considers that the oldest
museums and departments of anthropology in the
United States are located here. The usual explanation
seems satisfactory enough at first glance: there has
been no extensive record of anthropology in southern
New England because there are no subjects for study.
The indigenous people were among the first to experience
the ravages of contact with European colonists.
Disease, war, and forced migrations throughout the
17th and 18th centuries effectively depopulated the
area of most of its original inhabitants. Those few who
remained were supposedly detribalized and merged
with the Europeans. Even their artifacts were carted
off across the ocean to be placed in cabinets of curiosities.
To this day some of the best and largest ethnographic
collections of New England Indian material culture
are found in European museums and private
estates. Further, Colonial towns were located on prehistoric
and early historic Indian camps and villages,
and in other ways the growing industrial complex of
the Northeast covered over or erased the Indian sites.
As a result, at the end of the 19th century, when
anthropology as a formal discipline emerged, the native
peoples and most of the material vestiges of their
presence were gone.</p>

<p>There is undoubtedly much truth to this explanation,
but one must also examine the history of anthropology
in order to understand the reasons for this
relative neglect. Shortly after the turn of the century,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
the subjects anthropologists were seeking inevitably
led them westward to the Plains, the Southwest, and
other places where the frontier had only recently passed.
Anthropology at that time meant studying peoples
who still retained, or at most had only recently lost,
their tribal organization. Tribal societies were rapidly
disappearing and it was crucial that anthropologists
bend all their efforts to creating a record of these
peoples’ cultures before they were irretrievably lost.
The small groups of surviving Algonkian Indians in
southern New England, who retained few visible evidences
of their traditional culture, therefore attracted
almost no attention. Frank G. Speck is a notable exception
among the younger anthropologists who were prominent
in shaping the discipline in the United States.</p>

<p>The practice of anthropology today is considerably
different from the anthropology of 70 years ago. Tribal
cultures and societies which are still relatively intact
continue to be an important concern, but new dimensions
for the study of man have appeared. These new
developments make southern New England an important
resource for anthropological study. Inter-ethnic
relations are now attracting the attention of students
to a society which is no longer considered an inevitable
melting pot. Portuguese, French-Canadians, Italians,
and other immigrants have been a prominent part of
New England towns and cities for decades, but we
do not yet understand the processes by which they have
adapted to American culture. These ethnic segments
include the Wampanoag and other Indian groups who
have retained their Indian identity after over 300 years
of intensive contact. They obviously represent an important
phenomenon for study. Many Indian groups are
now moving to large cities, including Boston, and some
anthropologists are trying to understand how tribal
peoples adapt to urbanism as a way of life.</p>

<p>Ethnohistory, the writing of ethnographies from
historical documents, is another relatively new way of
practicing anthropology. Although the source materials
for southern New England are not as rich as
those from other areas in North America, there is
still a great deal which can be mined from them. Early
colonists traded, fought, and proselytized the Indians
and the accounts and records they left contain many
possibilities for studying cultural processes. We are
learning that the value of documents as source materials
is as much a function of their ability to answer
the kinds of questions that intrigue us as it is a
matter of bulk.</p>

<p>It is true that archaeology in New England has
been generally less immediately rewarding than in
many other areas of North America. The poorer conditions
of preservation, the apparent absence of deeply
stratified sites and the dense settlement pattern in
this region have contributed to this condition. With the
emergence of what is now being called historical
archaeology, however, new potentials are being realized
in New England. The efforts of Plimoth Plantation are
showing dramatically that Colonial history can be meaningfully
rewritten through the lenses of anthropology
and that archaeology does not by any means end where
history begins. Indeed, a new understanding is being
achieved for that period in early Colonial history when
an immigrant European culture was transformed into
something distinctively American.</p>

<p>For many anthropological studies that will undoubtedly
be made about southern New England, the
culture of the 17th century Indians will be an important
baseline. This monograph will be one of the
valuable sources for scholars undertaking such studies.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_WAMPANOAGS">THE WAMPANOAGS IN THE<br>
SEVENTEENTH CENTURY<br>
An Ethnohistorical Study</h2>

<p class="noindent"><i>by Catherine Marten</i></p>

<p class="p1 noindent"><em>And also those which should escape or overcome these
difficulties, should yett be in continuall danger of the
salvage people; who are cruell, barbarous, and most
trecherous, being most furious in their rage, and merciles
wher they overcome; not being contente only to
kill, and take away life, but delight to tormente men
in the most bloodie manner that may be; fleaing some
alive with the shells of fishes, cutting of the members
and joynts of others by peesmeale; and broiling on the
coles, eate the collops of their flesh in their sight
whilst they live, with other cruelties horrible to be
related.</em></p>


<p class="p2">One of many fearsome prospects awaiting Europeans
who would settle upon the American continent
was thus described by William Bradford—Indians.
In faraway Europe this simplistic view of the cruel and
hostile primitives that inhabited the New World seemed
adequate. But Bradford and his friends—known
to history as the Pilgrims, who settled at Plymouth
Massachusetts in 1620—were destined to see one
group of North American Indians in a different way.
Who were the Indians that greeted the Pilgrims and
what can be told of their culture?</p>

<p>The Indians that inhabited New England are often
collectively designated as Algonquians. This name actually
signifies a group of tribes whose languages are
related and are therefore classified together as members
of the Algonquian language family. Speakers of
Algonquian languages are not restricted to New England,
however; rather they are spread widely over the
North American continent. To the west on the Great
Plains such tribes as the Blackfoot and the Arapaho,
to the north the Naskapi, Abnaki, and Micmac, and to
the south along the Atlantic Coast the Powhattan and
the Chickahominy are a few examples of members
of this large linguistic family. Besides noting that the
languages spoken by these groups are related to one
another, we can also speak of some broad similarities
in culture shared by speakers of Algonquian languages.
However, by the time of European contact both languages
and cultures had diversified enough that Algonquian
speakers from widely separated areas would
not have understood one another’s speech and customs.</p>

<p>The tribe of Algonquians with which this monograph
is chiefly concerned is the Wampanoags, which
inhabited the immediate area around New Plimoth
and from whose ranks came such familiar figures as
Squanto, Massasoit, Hobomock, and Metacomet (King
Philip). This tribe was also sometimes called the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
Pokanokets, after Pokanoket, Rhode Island, where the
Sachems kept their principal headquarters.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Note_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Because
they were closely related linguistically and culturally,
however, one can with justification include information
pertaining to the immediate neighbors of the Wampanoags—the
Nausets, the Massachusetts, and the
Narragansetts.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Note_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The lumping of these groups for the
purpose of more completely filling out a cultural
description of the Wampanoags is further legitimatized
by the fact that since the devastation caused by a
plague in 1616 or 1617 the members of these tribes
had intermixed to some extent anyhow. The Indian
village of Patuxet had formerly been located on the
site where the Pilgrims were to establish New Plimoth;
it had been wiped out by a plague. The sole survivor
from Patuxet was Squanto, who had joined the band
of a sachem called Massasoit.</p>

<p>Political relationships among the Indian groups
of southeastern New England were variable depending
upon the leadership abilities and popularity of their
several sachems at various times. Massasoit and his
immediate successors seem to have been quite powerful
rulers and to have held the several sub-tribes of
Wampanoags into a cohesive body.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Note_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> At various times
the Wampanoags ruled the Nauset of Cape Cod. They
were frequently allied with the Massachusetts and were
frequently at war with the Narragansetts. At the time
when the Pilgrims arrived both the Wampanoags and
the Massachusetts were considerably weakened in
numbers by the plague of a few years earlier, which
had left the Narragansetts relatively unscathed. The
Wampanoags seem to have recognized in the new
arrivals a potential ally, hence the Pilgrims were welcomed,
albeit cautiously.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Note_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The pages that follow attempt to describe as
fully as possible the culture of the Wampanoags as it
would have been during the lifetime of Plymouth
Colony—1620 to about 1690. A few words are in
order in regard to sources of information. The normal
procedure for gaining ethnographic information is for
a trained observer—usually an anthropologist—to
live among the people he wants to study, interviewing
informants and observing with the aid of notebook,
tape recorder, and camera the activities and habits
of the groups under study. This sort of a systematic
investigation, however, is an invention of modern anthropology
and is a phenomenon dating only to the
last hundred years or so. Long before that time, contact
with the technology, ideology, and diseases of Europeans
had so altered the culture and diminished the
numbers of most of the Eastern seaboard tribes, including
the Wampanoags, that such a study would
have been impossible. To describe the culture of the
Wampanoags, therefore, it is necessary to turn to the
historical record—both written and archaeological—for
the only surviving information on these people.</p>

<p>The best sources for information on Wampanoag
culture are the journals and letters of travelers and
settlers of the 16th and 17th centuries. Among the
Pilgrims, Edward Winslow proved to be an exceptional
ethnographer, having recorded a number of insightful
observations on Indian culture. John Winthrop of Massachusetts
Bay sent a collection of Indian artifacts back
to England, some of which are still preserved in the British
Museum. Of lesser value to the present purpose are
writings of the latter half of the 17th century by
missionaries who were trying to teach Christianity to
the Indians. Their interests were in the progress of the
civilized customs of a godly existence, and their
writings do not focus upon aboriginal behavior. Information
about artifacts and structures, often incompletely
described by earlier chroniclers, can be added
to by a study of the archaeological remains of Indian
activity.</p>

<p>There will be omissions from the cultural description—questions
never to be answered. But it is
hoped that the bringing together in ethnographic format
of what information is extant will give some insight
into and further the understanding of Wampanoag
culture as it was at approximately the time the Pilgrims
encountered it.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="DEMOGRAPHY">DEMOGRAPHY</h3>

<p>Estimates of population for the southern New
England area are variable. The most widely quoted
figure is that arrived at by Mooney—25,000 for the
entire New England area, prior to the 1616-17 plague.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Note_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Other writers place the number at around 20,000 for
southern New England alone.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Note_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In all likelihood, the lower
number is the more nearly correct. Population estimates
made by visitors to the New England area in the
16th and 17th centuries were based in the main upon
what could be observed in the course of a coastwide
voyage. And while Indian population appeared dense,
the actual situation was one of a considerably concentrated
population along the immediate coast, where rich
marine resources were available, and a very sparse,
often seasonal, occupation of vast tracts further inland.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Note_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>By the time the Pilgrims arrived, the population
of eastern Massachusetts had declined greatly, as a
result of the epidemic which we have mentioned before.
No one really knows what the disease was that took
such great numbers of Indians. The Massachusetts
were virtually destroyed—first by the plague and
then by wars with the Abnaki during the early decades
of the seventeenth century. Population declined from
perhaps three thousand to a mere five hundred between
the years 1615 and 1630.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Note_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The Wampanoags had
suffered less, but the effects of the plague were still
felt heavily by them. Prior to the plague their numbers
are estimated to have been two to three thousand, but
death depopulated large tracts of land.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Note_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Altham writes
that the nearest Indian town to Plymouth was fourteen
miles away.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Note_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Gookin called them, “a potent nation
in former times....”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Note_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In 1620 they numbered perhaps
something over one thousand.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Note_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The Narragansetts,
however, were untouched by the plague; they
are said to have numbered some four thousand.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Note_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The general result of the settlement of Europeans in
New England was to further the trend of Indian depopulation.
Whereas the Europeans might hope to have
developed or inherited a degree of immunity to the
diseases which they carried, such infections proved
fatal to the Indians almost without exception. In
1632-33 the Narragansetts suffered a smallpox epidemic
which killed some seven hundred, and at the
same time it destroyed what remained of the Massachusetts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
tribe.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Note_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The well-meaning attempts of missionaries
to Christianize the Indians by civilizing them and
putting them into European clothes and houses also
brought changes to the detriment of their general
health. The “civilized” custom of washing, for example,
removed the coating of animal fat that the Indian
customarily wore to protect himself from cold and
insects and exposed his body to previously unknown
physiological shocks. Wars of the colonial period also
took their toll of the Indian population.</p>

<p>As far as can be told from available information,
the density of population in New England just prior
to European colonization was .22 Indians per square
mile.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Note_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="HISTORY">HISTORY AND CULTURE CHANGE</h3>

<p>The few remnants of Wampanoag oral tradition
are vague on the point of tribal history and origins.
Most often mentioned is the idea that they came from
somewhere to the south and west of their present
home. Indeed, this may, according to the thinking of
anthropologists, be the direction from which they
received the corn that they were cultivating in at least
the 16th century. However, the question of a true
tribal history must, as is so often the case with
pre-literate peoples, remain unanswered.</p>

<p>Early explorers and settlers had their own ideas as
to the origins of the Indians they found in the New
World. A popular belief was that these were descendants
of one of the Biblical “lost tribes of Israel”.
Some scholars went to great lengths to show that this
was so by comparing the languages and religious
concepts of the two groups. Along with this idea went
a belief that the skin of the Indians was actually light,
but that it was dyed brown during infancy.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Note_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Whatever
may have been the course of their pre-contact history,
the arrival of the white man was certainly a significant
event for the culture of the Indians of southeastern
New England.</p>

<p>Changes were being introduced into Indian culture
long before the arrival of the first permanent European
settlers. Fishing and whaling industries brought large
numbers of ships (nearly four hundred in 1578) to
the vicinity of Newfoundland and Cape Breton; incidental
trade in furs between the Indians and these
vessels covered a six-hundred mile range that undoubtedly
included New England.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Note_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Indian graves which
date from this period contain European trade items—the
first evidence of the changes being introduced into
native culture.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Note_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The Indians seem especially to have
appreciated the value of the metal tools which the
Europeans brought.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Note_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Their own use of metal had been
limited to the making of ornaments out of native copper.
For heavy work, such as felling trees and dressing
game, stone tools were used.</p>

<p>The increasing substitution of metal tools for
stone ones brought about changes in Indian technology
that continued through the seventeenth century. The
situation for New England Indians in general is summarized
by Willoughby:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>After and during the first two or three decades
of the seventeenth century the Indians received
from European traders, especially from the French
and Dutch, cloth, kettles, hatchets, and many
other objects, and the graves of that period have
yielded numerous articles of this nature. The
native industries of the people rapidly declined.
It was principally among the women that the finer
arts survived for a time, such as the better class
of bag and basket making, porcupine and moose-hair
embroidery, etc., although the men continued
for a period the production of their excellent
wooden bowls and drinking cups.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Note_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Technological change was not, however, only a
matter of the loss of skill at aboriginal crafts. The
Indians were quick to learn useful new techniques from
the English settlers. They learned the art of pewter
casting, and thus produced pipes and buttons.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Note_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> A
further use for their new-found knowledge of metallurgy
was noted by Governor Bradford:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They have also their moulds to make shotte, of
all sorts, as muskett bulletts, pistoll bullets,
swan and gose shote, and of smaler sorts; yea,
some have seen them have their scruplates to
make scrupins themselves, when they wante them,
with sundery other implements, wher with they
are ordinarily better fited and furnished then the
English them selves.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Note_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The history of contact between primitive peoples
and Europeans has tended to be similar throughout
the world, in that the first to contact and deal with the
natives were usually entrepreneurs looking for new
profits, followed by missionaries looking to save souls.
The Wampanoags likewise experienced this phenomenon.
While it was the intention of those who went there
to settle to bring Christianity to the Indians, preparations
for such a monumental task were not very well
laid. English colonists had their hands full for a
number of years just getting a living. They had made
no provisions for the maintenance of missionaries to
the Indians, and English congregations were not eager
to spare their own ministers for the task. Thus, it was
not until the middle of the seventeenth century at least
before systematic attempts to change the Indians’
belief system were begun.</p>

<p>Notable among those who took up the mission
to the Indians of southeastern Massachusetts and
Rhode Island were Roger Williams, John Elliot, and
the Mayhews, father and son. Quite a number of
converts were made.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Note_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Converted Indians were encouraged
to dwell together in what came to be dubbed
“praying towns”. Such Indians were required to adopt
European culture wholeheartedly in terms of dress,
housing, habits, etc., and they were required to learn
to read as part of their conversion so that they could
study the scriptures. The majority of Indians seem to
have refused conversion; however, the change on
the part of some of them can hardly but have had
influence upon the rest.</p>

<p>Another introduction from European culture was
alcohol, previously unknown to the Wampanoags and
their neighbors. This became a popular item of trade,
and some Indians undertook the cultivation of apples
for the purpose of making cider.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Note_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<h3 id="FOOD_QUEST">FOOD QUEST</h3>

<p><b>Annual Cycle</b>: The environment of coastal southern
New England was rich in a variety of wild food resources.
Because these resources were available seasonally
in several differing localities, the Wampanoags,
who lived by a combination of hunting, fishing,
collecting, and horticulture, moved several times during
the year.</p>

<p>Beginning in about April, large numbers of
Indians, probably the populations of several localized
winter camping groups, would gather at the falls of
certain rivers for the upstream runs of fish such as
herring.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Note_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Migratory birds were also taken at this time.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Note_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
The period of taking fresh water and androgynous fish
along streams and in lakes continued until planting
season, when the Wampanoags moved to the coast.</p>

<p>Summer was a time of gardening; it was also
the time when the vast array of marine resources was
exploited. In addition, summer brought an abundance
of shore birds. Planting involved two crops, with people
sometimes moving from a house by an early field to
one by a later field in the middle of the summer.</p>

<p>Deer were hunted in the fall; men moved away
to the forest to catch the migrating animals. Sometimes
women and children would be included in the
hunting expedition, if the distance to be traveled was
not too far from their summer home. But some people
stayed in their summer residences through the hunting
season, probably to harvest the last crop. Hunting
sometimes lasted until the snow was too deep to move
in.</p>

<p>After hunting season the fall and summer encampments
were abandoned, and people moved inland,
joining with other summer village groups to take up
winter quarters in what Williams describes as “thick
warme vallies”. There was greater protection from the
weather away from the shore, and the warm weather
food resources were gone—even the fish moved
offshore into deeper waters. From December or
January until April, Indians occupied these winter
camps and lived on food they had stored during
summer and fall and on what could be caught through
the ice or trapped during the winter. With the return
of spring, they would once again congregate at their
fishing places.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Note_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><b>Collecting</b>: A number of wild plants were utilized
by the Wampanoags for food. These included wild peas,
strawberries, gooseberries, raspberries, currants, chestnuts,
acorns, walnuts, ground nuts, and the Jerusalem
artichoke.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Note_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Doubtless other nuts, roots, and berries
not specifically named by the early observers were also
collected.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Note_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The ground nut (<i>Apios tuberosa</i>) was one of
the most important of the wild roots that the Indians
used for food.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Note_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> It also helped the Pilgrims keep away
starvation during the winter of 1623.</p>

<p>A part of the inventory of collected foods consisted
of shellfish. Clams were dug by the women at
low tide. Also noted specifically were: horseshoe crab,
lobster, oyster, crab, soft-shelled clam, and mussel.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Note_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
The following passage tells of the troublesome quest
for lobsters:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is an every dayes walke, be the weather cold
or hot, the waters rough or calme, they must dive
sometimes over head and eares for a Lobster,
which often shakes them by their hands with a
churlish nippe, and bids them adiew. The tide
being spent, they trudge home two or three miles,
with a hundred weight of Lobsters at their backs,
and if none, a hundred scoulds meete them at
home, and a hungry belly for two dayes after.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Note_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>
</div>

<p><b>Fowling</b>: The various types of fowl that were taken
included turkeys, ducks, geese, pigeons, cormorants,
and cranes.<a id="FNanchor_32a" href="#Note_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> This is only a partial list (again the kinds
cited specifically by contemporary sources) of the kinds
of birds that were actually hunted; there was an
abundance of both shore and land birds to be taken
at various seasons.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Note_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Turkeys seem to have been particularly
numerous.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Note_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Pigeons were abundant in Worchester
County, so much so that Williams describes
it as having been called “Pigeon Countrie”. They were
attracted by ripe strawberries and the old garden plots
of the Indians, and they were eaten in great numbers
because they were well-liked and easy to kill.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Note_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The techniques of taking fowl were various.
Shooting with bow and arrow was one method, and
Indians were very anxious to get guns and shot from
the English for the same purpose.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Note_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Williams says that
hunting involved enduring the weather, “... wading,
lying, and creeping on the ground, &amp;C.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Note_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The method
of getting cormorants was to sneak up on them at night
as they slept on the rocks along the shore.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Note_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Netting
birds at their feeding places was another way of
capture.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Note_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p><b>Hunting and Trapping</b>: Among the animals hunted
or trapped were deer, moose, beaver, bear, wolf, wild
cat, racoon, otter, muskrat, and fox.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Note_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> While all of these
were eaten, the importance of the smaller animals lay
mainly in their pelts. Deer seem to have been the most
important of the animals that were hunted.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Note_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Moose
and bear were also of major importance in New England,
according to the evaluation of William Wood.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Note_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
Probably the deer was more important to southern
New England groups like the Wampanoags, with the
frequency and relative importance of moose rising as
one traveled northward.</p>

<p>Techniques for taking deer fall into three categories:
stalking and shooting, the use of snares, and
the use of drives.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Note_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The stalking method calls to mind
the familiar image of an Indian stealthily pursuing a
deer through the forest with great skill and patience,
using bow and arrow as his weapons. No less important,
however, was the use of snares. A snare for
deer was made by bending a springy sapling down,
fastening it in place, and affixing some sort of noose
that would catch the deer by the leg when he, by
stepping into it, released the fastening that held the
tree down. Acorns were used to bait the snare. Wood
tells us that the traps were “... so strong as it
will tos a horse if hee be caught in it....”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Note_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> When
the Pilgrims went exploring on Cape Cod they encountered
such a device:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As we wandered we came to a tree, where a
young sprit was bowed down over a bow, and
some acorns strewed underneath. Stephen Hopkins
said, it had been to catch some deer. So as
we were looking at it, William Bradford being
in the rear, when he came looked also upon it,
and as he went about it, it gave a sudden jerk
up, and he was immediately caught by the leg.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
It was a very pretty device, made with a rope of
their own making, and having a noose as artificially
made as any roper in England can make,
and as like ours as can be....<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Note_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">These devices were also sometimes used for trapping
moose, bears, wolves, wild cats and foxes.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Note_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Most hunting was carried out during the fall,
after a spring and summer of watching the habits and
locations of the deer.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Note_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Ten to twenty or more men
from a village would move into temporary quarters
in the woods to hunt at this time, each man retiring
to his own well-defined hunting territory of “...
two, three or foure miles, where hee sets thirty, forty,
or fiftie Traps....”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Note_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> It was necessary to tend such a
trapline closely, since the human hunter competed
with other carnivores for his kill. A circuit of the traps
was made every two days. Even so, the hunter might
find that a wolf had been there before him, seeing
which, he would set to building a trap for the wolf as
well.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Note_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Unlike the two proceeding techniques, taking deer
by means of drives required the cooperative efforts of
a number of people. This number might range from
twenty to three hundred, according to one observer.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Note_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
Fences of brush were built, sometimes a mile or two in
length, through the woods, in the shape of a funnel.
Deer were chased into the wider end, and Indians
waited at the narrow end to shoot them as they passed.
Since it was possible for the deer to leap over the
fence, the hunters were careful not to startle them.
Working at night, they set snares for the deer that
had escaped their arrows.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Note_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> If the evidence from
other Indian groups can be applied in this case, it
can be said that the hunting party included women and
older children as well as the hunters themselves, and
that these former were stationed along the length of
the brush fence, outside it, to keep the deer from
jumping over.</p>

<p>There is evidence that another technique of
hunting common in North America, especially among
the Algonquians farther north, was also used by the
Wampanoags: driving the deer into water where they
are more vulnerable to the hunters. There is no direct
description of this process taking place, but there is
the information that laws made special provision for
paying the sachem within whose territory a deer was
shot in the water.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Note_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> And Williams tells us that there
is a special word to designate the skin of such a deer.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Note_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Another hunting device, used for beavers, otters,
and wolves, was the deadfall.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Note_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> One variety was made
by piling up a large number of rocks, designed to fall
on the animal which entered the trap.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Note_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> This style of
trap was used because these were animals capable of
gnawing their way out of a trap that left them alive.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Note_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Apparently allied to hunting, at least in part, was
the practice of setting fire to the woods at intervals,
in order to burn out the undergrowth.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Note_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Where this
was not done the woods were difficult to travel through,
and thick scrub would have hampered deer drives
considerably.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Note_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p><b>Marine Hunting</b>: Marine hunting was not a major
activity of the Wampanoags as it was of the Indian
groups further to the north; however, it was practiced
to some extent. Seals were taken as they napped on
rocks in the warm sun.<a id="FNanchor_58a" href="#Note_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Various species of whale were
also common along the more exposed coasts, but it is
not known if the Wampanoags actually hunted them in
boats. They did make use of both the flesh and the
oil of those that were cast up on the beaches.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Note_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p><b>Fishing</b>: Fish were a major dietary item in the
spring and continued to be of importance during the
remainder of the year. Both fresh and salt water fish
were taken. These included: bass, bream, cod, mackerel,
flatfish,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Note_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> skate, haddock, striped bass, sturgeon,
Atlantic salmon, shad, herring, frostfish,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Note_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> eels, lampreys,
trout, roach, dace, pike, perch, catfish and
pickerel.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Note_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Of these the salmon, trout, shad, herring,
bass, and sturgeon run up the fresh water streams
from the sea.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Note_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Trout, roach, dace, pike, perch, catfish,
and pickerel are fresh water species only.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Note_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Techniques for catching fish varied with the circumstances.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Note_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
The hook and line apparently came in
for a good deal of use.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Note_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> However, the only specific
fish for which its use is mentioned are bass and cod.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Note_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
To take these fish, the hooks were baited with lobsters.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Note_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
Probably the hook and line was used for ice
fishing during the winter, and if so it was also used
for pike, perch, bream, and pickerel.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Note_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Nets were used to take sturgeon.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Note_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Nets were
placed across rivers at the falls to take bass. The
trapped fish were then shot with arrows or speared.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Note_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
Bass were also caught in weirs.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Note_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The tending of nets
went on at night as well as during the day, the fishermen
resting on the shore near small fires until it was
time to check their nets.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Note_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Sturgeon were also taken at
night—using a different technique. A torch was waved
about over the side of the canoe to lure the fish. When
the fish came near, an Indian in the canoe would drive
a harpoon into his belly. Thus secured, the struggling
fish was dragged back to shore.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Note_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The method of
taking eels was to wade into the water, tread them out
of the mud with the feet, then grab them.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Note_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="DOMESTICATED_ANIMALS">DOMESTICATED ANIMALS</h3>

<p>The Wampanoags’ only domesticated animal at
the time the Europeans arrived was the dog.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Note_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Later,
those Indians who adopted European culture as part
of their conversion to Christianity seem to have begun
keeping the types of livestock—cattle, sheep, goats,
pigs, chickens, etc.—brought by the settlers.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Note_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="AGRICULTURE">AGRICULTURE</h3>

<p>Horticulture was a major occupation of the
Wampanoags from the spring until fall. Chief among
their crops was the native American corn, <em>Zea mays</em>.
Historical sources mention a number of colors—red,
blue, yellow, and white.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Note_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Of the squashes and their
relatives (all grouped into the family Cucurbitacae)
there are mentioned pumpkins and cucumbers.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Note_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Also
cultivated was the native American variety of tobacco,
<i>Nicotiana rustica</i>.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Note_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Gardening was work done by women, except for
tobacco growing, which was the business of men.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Note_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
The implements of cultivation were such things as
clam shell hoes, and fish were used for fertilizer. During<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
the time that the corn was growing the women would
weed it and protect it from birds. Watch houses might
be built in the fields where the gardener or her older
children would sit all day to frighten away birds.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Note_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
Sometimes hawks were captured, tamed, and kept
nearby the house in order to chase the other birds
away from the corn fields.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Note_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Corn might be harvested green or allowed to
ripen in the fields, depending upon the use for which
it was intended. Green corn seems to have been a
favorite food, and to get as much as possible two
plantings might be made during a summer.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Note_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> At harvest
time the women gathered in the corn and prepared it
for consumption or storage.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Note_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>When preparing a new field the first step was to
remove the forest cover. Trees were cut down, leaving
only the stumps; the branches were burned on the spot.
Ashes left from the burning enriched the soil. Gardens
were then planted between the stumps.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Note_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> A field thus
prepared would gradually diminish in fertility over a
period of years of continuous use, despite the addition
of organic fertilizers (fish) with each planting. When
this happened, the field was left fallow for a period of
time, during which a cover of weeds and brush would
develop. This cover was then burned off, the ashes
worked into the soil, and the field planted again.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Note_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="FOOD_PROCESSING">FOOD PROCESSING</h3>

<p><b>Preservation and Storage</b>: Both animal and vegetable
foods were preserved by drying.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Note_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> With this
technique, there was constant danger of spoilage
through dampness. Prior to the arrival of the European
settlers, salt was not available to the Wampanoags for
food preservation.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Note_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The method of drying fish and
shellfish was to cut it into thin strips and hang it on
a scaffold over a fire prepared for that purpose. Both
the sun and the fire worked to dry the fish quickly; the
fire served the additional purpose of keeping away
flies, which would have spoiled the food.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Note_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> At night
or when the weather was humid, the drying fish was
moved to the warm, smoky interior of the wigwam to
hang above the fireplace.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Note_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Corn, chestnuts, currants,
beans, and acorns were also preserved by drying. There
is no description of the process, save that they were
spread out on mats.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Note_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Vegetable foods were stored in specially constructed
pits in the ground. After they had been dug,
the pits were lined with woven mats. The dried fruits
or vegetables that were to be stored were put into
large baskets (The Pilgrims told of digging up one
such basket that had a capacity of three or four
bushels<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Note_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>); the baskets were put into the pits, covered
with more mats and perhaps wooden planks, and the
whole thing was covered with earth so that a small
mound marking the place was formed.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Note_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> When such
could be obtained, a metal pot rather than a basket
might serve as a storage container.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Note_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The dried fish
was also stored for winter use, but there is no mention
of its being put into the storage pits. It might have
been kept in some sort of woven or bark container in
the house.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Note_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p><b>Food Preparation</b>: Meat and fish were prepared
by boiling or roasting.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Note_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Meat was roasted by putting
it on the end of a forked stick placed in the ground
near the fire.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Note_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Fresh or dried meat, fish, and shellfish
were cut into small pieces and boiled into a stew—whose
constituent parts probably varied according to
what was available on any given day. A pot of this stew
was probably kept over the fire almost all the time,
and as some was eaten new ingredients were added.
As the following passage by Wood suggests, it was “... made
thicke with Fishes, Fowles, and Beasts boyled
all together; some remaining raw, the rest converted
by over-much seething to a loathed mash....”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Note_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
Vegetables were also added to the stew pot. Jerusalem
artichokes, ground nuts and other roots, pumpkins,
squashes, corn, and beans are mentioned specifically.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Note_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
Walnuts, acorns, and chestnuts were ground into a
powder and added to the broth to thicken it.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Note_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Clam
juice, which functioned as a substitute for salt, was
added as seasoning.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Note_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Williams tells of another sort
of dish, prepared from the heads of bass, “... the
braines and fat of it being very much and sweet as
marrow”.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Note_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Notes by John Winthrop give the designation
<em>Sukatash</em> to a dish which is venison, fish and
Indian corn boiled together.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Note_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Vegetable foods were also prepared in a number
of other ways and combinations. Whole corn was
boiled—with or without beans.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Note_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Corn ground into
meal was an important item in the diet of the Wampanoags.
Corn kernels were dried and parched in the
coals of the fire. Ashes were then sifted out of the
parched corn, and it was ground fine with hand milling
equipment. A woman then sifted the meal through a
basketry sieve to catch out unground lumps, and the
result was a meal called <em>Nocake</em>. Nocake was the food
of anyone when on a journey away from home. A few
spoonfuls made a meal; it was taken with water to
facilitate swallowing.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Note_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>For use at home, the parched meal might be
mixed with water and boiled into a porridge.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Note_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> In a
more elaborate recipe it was mixed with crushed
strawberries, made into dough, wrapped in leaves and
baked in the ashes to make a kind of bread.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Note_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> It was
also made into small cakes that were boiled. Williams
mentions a dish made by mixing corn meal with
powdered dried currants, “... which is as sweet to
them as plum or spice cake to the English”.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Note_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> He
also says that clam juice was used as a seasoning for
bread.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Note_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Of the nuts used by the Wampanoags, acorns
required additional work, since the bitter tannic acid
had to be removed from them by some sort of leaching
process before they could be eaten. This was done by
boiling.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Note_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Oil was extracted from walnuts and used
for a variety of purposes.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Note_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="FOOD_CONSUMPTION">FOOD CONSUMPTION</h3>

<p>The diet of the Wampanoags, because of their
seasonal cycle of resource use, varied considerably.
While many kinds of food were preserved for use
beyond their season by drying, the supply was probably
not so great that the diet was identical throughout the
year, if only in terms of the relative quantities of the
kinds of food eaten. The diet of the Wampanoags included
several varieties of land animals,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Note_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
deer were probably the most important. Fresh and
salt water fish, shellfish, fowl, and marine mammals,
such as were available, were also eaten. Corn, beans,
and cucurbits, which they raised, plus various wild
nuts, roots, and fruits made up the vegetable part of
the diet. While there is evidence that the Indians in
Maine used maple sugar, there seems to have been
none used in southeastern New England aboriginally.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Note_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
Altogether, according to Bennett, who has made a study
of the diet of the Indians of southeastern New England,
the Indian diet included more vegetable products than
the diet of Europeans living in the same area today.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Note_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>Squashes came to replace corn as the dietary
mainstay in the late summer.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Note_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Clams seem to have
been dug in all seasons of the year; they are spoken
of as a food to which the Wampanoags turned when
other sources of food dwindled.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Note_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Acorns were also
a food turned to when the preferred diet was scarce,
although sometimes they were eaten when there was
plenty of corn, as a novelty item.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Note_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Writing of a visit
to the Plymouth area in June, Martin Pring noted that
the food the Indians were eating at that time of the
year was mostly fish.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Note_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>There is not a great deal known about Wampanoag
eating habits, but some general impressions can be
put together. Morton tells us that “... they feede
continually”.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Note_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Wood, on the other hand, notes that
it was “... their fashion to eate all at some times,
and sometimes nothing at all in two or three dayes....”<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Note_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
The apparent contradiction is probably the
result of the two observers looking at different sets
of cultural circumstances. When there was food available
in abundance, everyone probably ate, according
to his wishes, out of the stew pot at any time. There
were also formal meals held on at least the following
occasions: when a guest arrived (<em>i.e.</em> visiting Englishman)
and when groups would gather for games and
dances. Wood gives a description of what such a “sit-down”
meal was like:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... dishing it up in a rude manner, placing it
on the verdant carpet of the earth which Nature
spreads them, without either trenchers, napkins,
or knives, upon which their hunger-sawced stomacks
impatient of delayes fals aboard without
scrupling at unwashed hands, without bread, salt
or beere: Lolling on the Turkish fashion, not ceasing
till their full bellies leave nothing but emptie
platters ... eating three or foure cornes with a
mouthfull of fish or flesh, sometimes eating
meate first, and cornes after, filling chinkes with
their broth ... At home they will eate till their
bellies stand forth ready to split with fullness....<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Note_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>
</div>

<p>At this type of meal the men ate, and the women
waited upon them, being paid by the favor of a bite
from time to time.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Note_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Eating was done from individual
wooden bowls, with fingers or spoon, depending upon
the consistency of the food.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Note_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>When one was away from home on a journey and
not near enough to any settlement to go there for
hospitality, he ate from his pouch of parched corn
meal. This might be eaten quickly if he were in
a hurry to be off again, by gulping down three spoonfuls
of corn meal with some water. A more leisurely
meal was one for which the traveler took the trouble
to build a fire and cook the meal to eat it hot.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Note_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Food seems to have been shared liberally with
anyone who was around when people were eating,
no matter what it was or how much there was at the
time.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Note_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Diet was one area in which the arrival of the
Europeans seems not to have had much influence.
Composition of the diet remained the same as it was
aboriginally until the time of King Philip’s War.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Note_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="DRINK">DRINK, DRUGS AND INDULGENCE</h3>

<p>Prior to the arrival of the Europeans there was
no knowledge of alcohol among the Indians of the
New England area. Once introduced, however, it became
a popular item of trade, and Indians learned
how to produce it for themselves.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Note_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>The Wampanoags and their neighbors, however,
did smoke the native American variety of tobacco,
<i>Nicotiana rustica</i>.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Note_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> This strong variety of tobacco
would not be appealing to modern American tastes.
The only place where it is used commercially today
is in the USSR. In one instance at least—where the
writer characterized the tobacco as weak—it is
likely that some was mixed with other plant material
preparatory to smoking.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Note_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Tobacco leaves were picked
green, dried, crushed, and smoked in pipes.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Note_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Tobacco was used frequently.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Note_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Smoking was a
pleasant diversion. When friends met on the trail they
would stop, smoke together, and talk.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Note_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Tobacco apparently
also was used by women.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Note_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Besides being
a refreshing indulgence, taking tobacco was thought
to be a helpful remedy “... against the rheume,
which causeth the toothake....”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Note_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="LEATHER">LEATHER, TEXTILES, FABRICS</h3>

<p><b>Work in Skins</b>: Most of the clothing worn by the
Wampanoags was made from the skins of animals.
Deerskin was an excellent material for clothing, since
it was tough but thin enough to be made pliable, was
large enough to be used with a minimum of piecing,
and was readily available in the environment. Moose
hide was used for similar purposes, but being heavier
it was perhaps more popular for making shoes.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Note_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Deerskin was scraped to remove the flesh, and
the tanning process involved working oil into the hide
to make it soft and also resistant to water.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Note_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Thus
prepared, the skin used in a pair of leggings could
stand to be gotten wet, rung out, hung up and dried
by the fire without being harmed by the experience.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Note_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
When a deer was killed during the winter, the thick
coat of hair was usually left on the hide.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Note_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Moose
skins were de-haired as a matter of course, according
to Morton.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Note_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Deer and moose skins with the hair
removed were decorated by painting or by embroidery.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Note_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
To be a proper skin for wearing, a deerskin had
to have the tail left on.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Note_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>The skins of other game were also used as clothing.
Bear, otter, raccoon, beaver, fox and cat skins
are mentioned as having been used, although the
particulars of their preparation are not recorded.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Note_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
Sometimes the skins of animals not available in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
immediate vicinity were traded for from neighboring
tribes.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Note_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The skins of all these animals, including deer,
were used also for bedding.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Note_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Leather was used in the
manufacture of bags for carrying fire lighting equipment,
tobacco, and parched corn meal. The latter type
is described as being long and narrow and carried
either slung on the back or tied around the waist.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Note_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Contemporary observers do not mention any
further uses of leather by the Wampanoags. Among
several groups of Indians, such as those who lived by
hunting on the Great Plains, leather served not only
for clothing, but as the only material available for
housing and cordage. Living as they did in the woodlands,
the Wampanoags had available a variety of
suitable plant material which they used for various
kinds of basketry and cordage that served the multitude
of purposes served by leather in other regions.
Thus among the Wampanoags leather might have been
used as the lashings to hold the framing of houses
together, or plant fiber might have served this purpose,
or both. Such alternatives were available, but
it is not known exactly what use the Wampanoags made
of them.</p>

<p><b>Cordage, Netting, Basketry</b>: The Wampanoags
used the stems and fibers of several plants for containers,
house coverings, nets, clothing, etc.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Note_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Among
the plants used were: bulrushes, bent grass (perhaps
also other types of grasses), maize husks, “silk grass”,
wild hemp (also called Indian hemp and dogbane—<i>Apocynum
cannabenum</i>), flag leaves, basswood fiber,
and the bast of other trees with fine inner bark, such
as the linden and slippery elm.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Note_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Most cordage was made from wild hemp. Basically,
the manufacture of cordage consisted of removing
the long fibers from the stems of the plant and joining
these by twisting and braiding until the desired thickness
and length of cord was obtained. The Indians
appeared quite skillful in this craft: “... their cordage
is so even, soft, and smooth, that it looks more like
silke than hempe....”<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Note_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Wild hemp cordage was
used in several ways. It was used to make fishing
lines.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Note_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> It was also used for tying hooks onto these
lines.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Note_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Hemp cordage was looped into fishnets.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Note_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> One
of these, used for sturgeon, is described as being 30
to 40 feet in length.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Note_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Large storage bags were made
out of this material, in a weaving technique known as
twining. These were flat and rectangular in shape;
their capacity was five or six bushels. They were used
for storing food both in the underground pits and
inside the houses.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Note_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Similar bags were also made out
of bast fiber.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Note_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>Hemp is mentioned as having been used in
making baskets, where it probably served as weft
strands.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Note_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Hemp cordage was also used to sew together
a certain kind of house covering mat.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Note_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> And
it was used, along with grasses for woven capes.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Note_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
Mantles were also woven out of turkey feathers, or the
feathers of other birds, and cordage.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Note_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> The feathers
were probably twisted in among the hemp strands.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Note_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
Such weaving was done without looms.</p>

<p>Matting was produced by two basic techniques,
by sewing or by weaving the component elements
together. In sewn mats, flag leaves were sewed together
with wild hemp thread, using a bone needle.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Note_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Woven
mats were plaited from bulrushes.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Note_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> These latter
were used to line the interior of the house, to sit
upon, and for spreading out food to dry.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Note_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Matting
was an item that came in for extensive use in the
daily lives of the Wampanoags. Besides being a building
material, it was used to line storage pits; it also
lined or covered their graves.</p>

<p>Basketry was another important item made by
the Wampanoags, although their use of basketry was
not as extensive as in certain other North American
Indian groups. Basketry everywhere serves what is
basically a container function, and among the Wampanoags
there were available pottery, birch bark boxes,
pouches of leather, wooden dishes, and later the metal
pots and kettles brought by Europeans—all of which
could carry out the job of holding something.</p>

<p>Baskets were made in a number of sizes and shapes,
of several different materials, and of varying fineness
depending upon the purpose to be served.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Note_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> There
were two techniques for weaving baskets, twining and
plaiting, though there were probably enough variations
upon these basic techniques that not all baskets looked
alike to the casual observer. Twined basketry was the
more common type at the time that the Europeans
arrived in New England. The baskets of “Hempe and
Rushes” that Wood describes were probably made by
this technique.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Note_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> The manufacture of twined basketry
involves wrapping a horizontal weft element, the hemp
in this case, around what is usually a more rigid warp,
the bulrushes. The basketry made by the plaited technique
is what is meant by the term “splint basketry”.
In this case, both warp and weft are equally rigid
“splints” and are combined by placing each alternately
over the other so that, in the most basic pattern, a
checkerboard effect results. Basketry made by this
technique became more popular during the historic
period, and eventually this was the only type made by
the Indians in the New England area. At the time New
England was being colonized, the main use of splint
basketry was in the processing of corn. Square sieves
for sifting corn meal were made by the plaiting
technique, with varying grades of mesh to sort out
ground and hulled corn for various uses.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Note_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Collecting
baskets for harvesting corn were also made by this
technique. The basket was worn strapped to the back,
secured by a strap across the chest. A larger version
of the basket stood at the edge of the field, for
transporting the harvested ears of corn back to the
house.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Note_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>Willoughby gives this description of obtaining
and processing the materials for splint baskets:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... small ash, white oak, or other suitable trees,
were cut in the spring. The logs were sometimes
soaked in water, although this was not always
necessary. They were then peeled and beaten with
wooden mauls until the annual growth layers were
separated one from another. These were split
into various widths and assorted, strips of uniform
size being bound together in bunches or coils.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Note_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Baskets were also used to carry the parched
corn meal of a traveler (in place of the deerskin
pouch).<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Note_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Large baskets, an alternative to bags of
hemp, were used to store food in the underground
storage pits.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Note_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> One kind of arrow quiver was made of
basketry.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Note_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> When moving from place to place during
the year, basketry and soft woven bags seem likely to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
have been the containers in which the Wampanoags
carried their baggage.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Note_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Very few decorated baskets are known to have
survived from this period. The reports of early observers
note that baskets were decorated in various
colors.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Note_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> A basket seen by the Pilgrims is described
as being “... curiously wrought in black and white
in pretty works....”<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Note_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> But from such scant information
it is possible to generalize about decorative
style.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Note_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="CLOTHING">CLOTHING</h3>

<p>The basic dress for both men and women was
the breech clout—a length of deerskin that was
looped over a belt in back, passed between the legs,
and looped over a belt again in front.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Note_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> In post-contact
times this garment was sometimes made of
cloth.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Note_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> The breech clout was worn at all times by
adults.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Note_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Female children wore such a garment or
its equivalent from early infancy; male children went
naked until they were ten or twelve years old.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Note_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>The Wampanoags did not wear a great deal
of additional clothing. For additional protection from
insects and cold, the Indians usually wore a thick
coating of animal or vegetable fat.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Note_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> The Wampanoags
might put on leggings when traveling through scratchy
undergrowth. Leggings consisted of two tubes of deerskin,
extending from ankle to groin, fastened into the
moccasin at the lower end and held up by attaching
them to the belt.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Note_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Leggings were worn by both sexes;
those worn by the women may have been somewhat
shorter.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Note_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Leggings were also worn as a protection
against the cold, especially by the older people.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Note_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>Skin capes were a common item of clothing for
both sexes.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Note_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Women’s capes, about twice as long as
those worn by men, are reported to have hung down
behind like a train.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Note_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Capes for summer wear were of
deerskin—either worn hair side out or made of de-haired
skins. For winter wear the hair was left on and
turned to the inside.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Note_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The skins of Beaver, otter,
racoon, bear, and fox—the smaller ones being sewed
together—were also used for winter mantles.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Note_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Mantles
made of turkey feathers were mentioned previously.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Note_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Champlain reported that Indians on Cape Cod
(probably Nauset) wore capes woven of grass and hemp
fibers.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Note_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> These extended to the thighs and may have
been worn in summer as a protection against insects.
Or, perhaps they were for special occasions. One
fragment of such a mantle, excavated along with a
burial near Manchester, Massachusetts, was made of
twilled bast fiber.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Note_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> The lower edge of the garment was
fringed.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Note_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>The skin mantle was usually worn passed under the
right arm, brought over the left shoulder, and the two
ends fastened.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Note_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> For traveling or other activity the
garment was bound tight against the body with a belt.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Note_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
In very cold weather the exposed arm was covered
with a detachable fur sleeve which was tied on.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Note_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> In
the absence of the sleeve, the mantle might be allowed
to hang loose, and the wearer alternately cover whichever
shoulder was exposed to the wind as he walked.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Note_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>Both men and women wore moccasins. The preferred
material for these was moose hide, but in its
absence, deerskin served.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Note_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Everyone went barefoot
in the summer, but they usually carried their moccasins
slung on their backs in case of having to travel over
very rough ground.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Note_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>Contact with Europeans brought changes in the
style and the material of some Indians’ clothing.
Indians were encouraged to adopt English styles of
dress as part of the process of their conversion to
Christianity. Many, however, found the European style
of clothing a nuisance. Wood says: “... their chief
reasons they render why they will not conforme to
our English apparell, are, because their women cannot
wash them when they bee soyled, and their means
will not reach to buy new when they have done with
their old; and they confidently beleeve, the English
will not be so liberall as to furnish them upon gifture:
therefore they had rather goe naked than be lousie....”<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Note_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
Often, articles of English clothing were worn
for special occasions.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Note_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Some Indians began selling
all their skins to European traders and using cloth to
make their traditional garments.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Note_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> The cloth which
they preferred was a blanket material called “duffils”
or “trucking cloth”.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Note_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Whatever the style and material
of their clothing, however, the Wampanoags preferred
to wear only the loincloth when they were in their own
houses.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Note_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p><b>Ornament</b>: Copper or brass, breast-plates, necklaces,
bandoliers, etc. are often mentioned by explorers
who visited the New England coast prior to the establishment
of permanent settlements.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Note_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> A change in
fashion apparently took place among the Indians of
southeastern New England during the early historic
period, however, for colonial writers describe the same
types of ornaments as being made of shell.</p>

<p>Breast-plates were solid sheets of copper or brass
hammered thin and flat.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Note_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> They were about a foot in
length and half that wide.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Note_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Sheet copper was also
made into tubular beads. These were about four inches
long and a quarter of an inch in diameter. They were
made by bending the sheet of metal around a stick
from which the pith had been removed to form a hole
for stringing.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Note_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Tubular beads were strung together
(long axes parallel) to make bandoliers. Bandoliers
were worn diagonally across the chest or sometimes
as belts around the waist.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Note_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Similar fillets made of
shorter copper beads were probably worn as headbands.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Note_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
Tubular copper beads strung end to end were
worn as necklaces.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Note_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Gorgets and pendant earrings
were also made out of copper and brass.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Note_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>By the time the Pilgrims arrived, shell ornaments
apparently had replaced the metal ornaments which
earlier chroniclers said were worn by everyone, for none
of the colonial writers mentions Indians wearing copper
or brass ornaments.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Note_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Most shell ornament was based
on beadwork, although shell, along with bone and
stone was used for ear pendants—cut-outs of birds,
fish, and other animals.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Note_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> By at least 1647 wampum
was the most popular style of shell beads.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Note_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>Wampum served as “money” and as ornament.
It was introduced into Plymouth colony as an item of
exchange in 1627 by the Dutch, for although it was
common among Indians to the south, it was virtually
unknown as an item of trading value to Indians around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
Plymouth and farther north.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Note_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> Important people in
the tribe had a few ornaments of wampum prior to
1627. Altham describes Massasoit in 1623 as wearing
a belt of shell beads that were probably wampum.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Note_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
After a slow start in Plymouth, wampum increased in
popularity until it was common to see Indians wearing
bracelets, necklaces, headbands, and belts, woven in
various designs of small purple and white beads.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Note_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
Collars, caps, and ear pendents were also made of
wampum.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Note_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> The beads were strung end to end as well
as being woven in bands.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Note_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>The wampum made in southern New England was
fashioned from the shells of the quahog, or hard-shelled
clam (<i>Venus mercenaria</i>).<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Note_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Bead blanks were
first roughed out from the whole shell then drilled
with a stone (later metal—introduced by Europeans)
drill. Beads were then strung together and ground
into their final shape with an abrasive stone.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Note_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>There were other, less popular, styles of shell
beads and beadwork.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Note_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Sometimes small discoidal
beads (probably quahog and periwinkle) were used
instead of the tubular wampum for beadwork, as
necklaces, bracelets, and hair ornaments. Like wampum,
these beads were white and purple in
color.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Note_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> There were also large tubular shell beads that
were strung for necklaces.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Note_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>Bone and seeds were also used for beads,<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Note_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> and
early explorers report necklaces of variously colored
stones.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Note_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>Besides jewelry, the Wampanoags used painting
and tattooing as means of personal adornment. Tattooing
was done by two techniques. A sharp instrument
was used to pierce and lift a small area of skin, and
black pigment was inserted into the wound. By repeating
these small incisions close together, decorative
lines were formed. This form of tattooing was done
on the cheeks; the patterns were zoomorphic “...
as Beares, Deares, Mooses, Wolves, &amp;c., some of fowls,
as of Eagles, Hawkes, &amp;c....”<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Note_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> The other technique
of tattooing was accomplished by “branding” with a
hot iron. Geometrical shapes were applied to the arms
and chest by this method.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Note_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>Body painting was done in red, yellow, white,
and black. Red powder was sometimes put onto the
hair.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Note_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> The body and hair were prepared for painting
by a thorough greasing; the grease provided a bond
for the pigment.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Note_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> Different colors might be used on
various sections of the face, or a single color might
be used for the whole face.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Note_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Both men and women
wore paint. Paint was worn for mourning, for war ceremonial
or festive occasions, and for games.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Note_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> Warriors
used lurid coloring to make them appear more terrible
to the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Note_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Painting the face black, with soot and
ashes, was a symbol of mourning.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Note_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> There were undoubtedly
many other associations between styles of
painting and specific events or social groups, but they
were not recorded by seventeenth century observers.</p>

<p><b>Hairdressing</b>: Of hairdressing, Lechford reported:
“They cut their haire of divers formes, according to
their Nation or people so that you may know a people
by their cut....”<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Note_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> There was also variation in hairstyle
within the social group. An unmarried girl could
be distinguished from a married women by her hair
style.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Note_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> At marriage, the women’s hair was cut off, and
until her hair grew back she wore a covering on her
head.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Note_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> A young man who was not yet a warrior could
be identified by his short haircut.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Note_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Further variation
noted among the adults of the same tribe may mean
that various kin groups used distinctive styles of hairdressing.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Note_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
Long hair was highly prized, and wearing
the hair in a tight “pony tail” was said to make it
grow faster.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Note_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Hairdressing was a daily activity which
involved oiling and, according to one writer, dyeing.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Note_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>Probable Wampanoag hairstyles include the following:
hair cut short into bangs in the front, the
remainder falling free to the shoulders; hair braided
into four braids with part of this knotted behind, and
with feathers and other sorts of ornaments stuck into
the knot; hair shaved from the front and sides of the
head, the remainder left long and made into a knot
with feathers in it.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Note_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>Various forms of ornament, frequently feathers,
were an integral part of certain hairstyles. Turkey and
eagle feathers are mentioned specifically for this
purpose.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Note_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Single feathers might be stuck into a knotted
portion or otherwise intertwined with the hair.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Note_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
Feathers were sometimes joined fan-shape and put
into the hair. Fox tails and other fur were also used
for hair ornament. Strips of deer hides, dyed red,
were tied on, in the manner of a cock’s comb.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Note_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Other
ornaments included ribbons of European manufacture
and ornamental combs carved from antler.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Note_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>Specific information on female styles of hairdress
is slight. Champlain describes one style which was a
combination of free-falling hair in back and various
braids for the rest.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Note_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Beyond this, there are no descriptions
that relate to the Wampanoags.</p>

<p>Sources are contradictory in the subject of facial
hair. Some writers report that Indians in this region
generally despised and plucked out what little facial
hair they had.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Note_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Another writer of the same period
relates that these Indians were at pains to preserve
their own thin beards and to add to them by fastening
on animal hair.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Note_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="EXPLOITATIVE">EXPLOITATIVE ACTIVITIES</h3>

<p><b>Lumbering and Forest Products</b>: Prior to contact
with Europeans the Wampanoags used stone tools for
lumbering. Large trees felled with these primitive implements
were used for the manufacture of dugout
canoes.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Note_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Birch bark, another product of the forest,
provided the material for house coverings and containers
of various sorts as well as material for another
type of canoe. As the range of the canoe birch (<i>B.
papyrifera</i>) had its southern limit at Cape Anne on
the immediate coast, the use of birch bark by the
Wampanoags was probably not so extensive as that
of some of their neighbors.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Note_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Nevertheless, by trade
and by seeking out individuals of the species that
grew beyond their range, birch bark was obtained and
used as an alternative material for the items mentioned
above.</p>

<p>Carved wooden bowls and spoons are said to have
been a craft specialty of the Wampanoags. Burls were
selected for carving material in order to avoid the
problem of splitting along the grain when an item was
subjected to repeated wetting and drying. Small objects
such as fish hooks were sometimes made of wood, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
there were other more obvious uses such as poles
for house frames, arrowshafts and handles for tools.
Bast fiber (inner bark) was used for various woven
items. A red dye was made from pine bark.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Note_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Turpentine
and pitch were also products of the pines.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Note_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p><b>Mining and Quarrying</b>: Both soapstones for bowls
and pipes and native copper for ornaments were obtained
aboriginally by New England Indian groups. So
far as is known, however, the Wampanoags did none
of the extraction of these materials themselves. They
obtained either the materials or the finished products
through trade.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Note_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>Pigments were probably obtained at various local
outcroppings. Limonite furnished yellow; hematite
served for some of the reds. The stone used for tools
and weapons—quartz and slate—was also locally
occurring material.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Note_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Clay for potting was available in
the Plymouth area.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Note_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="PROCESSING">PROCESSING OF BASIC MATERIALS</h3>

<p>There is documentary evidence on the manufacture
of only a few of the articles fashioned by the
Indians out of the products of their environment. In
most cases this evidence is fragmentary. What is
available is discussed below:</p>

<p><b>Stonecarving</b>: Both pipes and bowls were carved
out of soapstone. As far as is known, most of this work
was done by the Narragansetts in Rhode Island; their
products were traded into the Plymouth area. Bowls
of soapstone were produced wholly or in part at the
quarry where the raw material was obtained. Working
with picks and chisels of harder stone (later, presumably,
with metal tools) the craftsman would rough out
the general shape of the bowl, bottom side up, while it
was still attached to the parent block. Then he would
begin chipping away underneath the bowl and by inserting
a wedge remove it from the quarry. The inside
of the bowl was then hollowed out with smaller stone
adzes and chisels.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Note_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>Soapstone pipes required considerable skill to
manufacture, owing to their small size. Some of these
were elaborately ornamented with carved figures, but
authorities are still not sure whether the more elaborate
pipes were locally made or traded into the Narragansett
territory from elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Note_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Shaping and drilling were
originally done with stone tools, but steel drills were
later used in pipe manufacture.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Note_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p><b>Metallurgy</b>: The Indians learned to cast metal
from the English. Pewter, brass, and presumably lead
(for shot) were cast into ornaments, buttons, ammunition,
and gun parts.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Note_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>Buttons and other small ornaments were cast
out of pewter using one-piece moulds carved from soft
stone. Finishing was done by trimming and grinding
away the rough edges. The eyes of buttons were made
by trimming the metal with a knife.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Note_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p><b>Woodworking</b>: The Wampanoags were noted for
their skill in woodworking. They made dugout canoes
which might be as much as fifty feet long.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Note_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> To make a
canoe a suitable tree was first selected then laboriously
felled with a stone axe. (During historic times
metal tools came to perform this function and others
in the process of manufacture.)<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Note_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Initial hollowing out
of the log was done by burning.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Note_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Either the wood was
set afire or hot stones were placed on it.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Note_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> The fire
was carefully controlled; the idea was to remove the
inside and leave the outside intact on three sides.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Note_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
The process was a slow one, taking some ten to
twelve days.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Note_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> When the interior had been burned out
as much as possible, the job of hollowing and smoothing
was finished with shell scrapers.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Note_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> The outside was
hewn into shape with stone hatchets and the whole
craft was finished by sanding it with an abrasive stone.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Note_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
A similar procedure on a smaller scale was used to
fashion wooden bowls and spoons and other such utensils.
A bowl was first hollowed out by burning and then
smoothed to a high polish with abrasive stones.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Note_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>Birch bark canoes were made by the Massachusetts,
and Pring reports them in use by the
Wampanoag.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Note_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> The vessels or the material for them
might have been obtained in trade, or, as one writer
suggests, suitable-sized pieces of bark may have been
achieved by piecing together the bark of birches that
were stunted stragglers outside their normal range.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Note_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
Birch bark canoes have the advantage of being light
and easily transported over portages.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Note_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> These canoes
were joined by sewing, probably with bast fiber or
something similar.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Note_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> The seams were caulked with
rosin from the pitch pine.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Note_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> The vessels were strengthened
by placing broad, thin ribs across the inside
rather close together.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Note_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p><b>Other Manufactures</b>: The Indians also made glue
of a combination of deer antler and “fishes sounds”.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Note_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
Its use is mentioned for fletching arrows.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="STRUCTURES">STRUCTURES</h3>

<p><b>Architecture</b>: There were two basic architectural
styles used by the Wampanoags, both variations on a
single structural type: A framework made of poles—large
ends set into the ground, smaller ends bent to
meet each other and lashed together—along with
a series of horizontal elements that crossed the uprights
at regular intervals and a covering of bark or
woven mats. The smaller of the two styles was round
in floor plan, and basically hemispherical in shape.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Note_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
The larger type was oblong or oval in its floor plan,
the side framework being two rows of parallel poles,
retaining the rounded proof pattern.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Note_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p><b>Dwellings</b>: Both styles of house were used as
dwellings; which one was used depended upon the
season of the year. The larger house was a winter
dwelling, the type used when the various constituent
families of a village met to live together for that
season. Dimensions varied, depending upon the size
of the group that was living in the house.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Note_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> They are
described as being about thirty feet wide and ranging
from fifty to one hundred feet in length.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Note_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Each
family unit that lived in the house had its own fireplace,
and a smoke hole was left in the roof over each of
these.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Note_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> There was a door at each end of the
house.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Note_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>During the summer, when the Wampanoags were
engaged in gardening, ocean fishing, and shellfish collecting,
the smaller, round house was used. This is the
sort of house, probably occupied by one or two nuclear
family units, that early explorers saw strung out along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
the New England coast.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Note_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> The size of the house varied
according to the number of people to be fit in. Fifteen
to twenty feet would probably be a good estimate
of average diameter.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Note_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>The fireplace was located in the center of the
floor, and above it was a smoke hole about one and a
half feet across, which had a mat to cover it when
the wind was strong.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Note_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Doorways were low—about
a yard high—and had a mat or bark covering.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Note_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
The location of the door was shifted as the wind
changed; several panels were left with detachable
coverings for this purpose.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Note_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Some Indians got boards
and nails from the English and made doors and bolts
for their wigwams after the fashion of the colonists.
Both kinds of doors were fastened at night or if the
family were leaving for a journey. In the latter case, the
last one to leave fastened the door from the inside
and left the house via the smoke hole.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Note_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>House frames for both styles of house were
lashed together. One material mentioned for this use
was walnut bark.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Note_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> The outer covering of the house
was either bark or matting. The mats were made of
coarse grasses such as flagg or bulrush by sewing or
weaving.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Note_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> The bark used for house coverings was
birch or chestnut.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Note_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> It was removed from the trees
when the “sap was up”. Sheets of green bark were
placed under heavy logs to keep them from curling
while they dried.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Note_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> Bark-covered houses were considered
to be warmer and preferable to those covered
with mats.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Note_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>Bark covering is mentioned as being customary
for summer houses of the Narragansetts.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Note_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> Probably
bark covering was the rule for winter village longhouses,
since it was warmer. For groups dwelling
along the coast and on Cape Cod, mat covering is
most frequently mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Note_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Portability rather than
warmth was likely the important factor in “summer”
house coverings, since they also had to serve as
covering for the hunting house in the fall and the
fishing house in the spring. For this reason, mats were
probably preferred over bark for summer houses.
House frames were left standing when the family
moved, and they were re-used the next year.</p>

<p>These houses were largely both dry and warm.
There was a second layer of matting made of bulrushes
on the inside of the house for added insulation. Since
they were small and the fire was always burning, they
were quite smoky, especially when the smoke hole
and the door were closed against the elements. At
such times the people inside often had to lie close to
the floor in order to breathe properly.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Note_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p><b>Other Structures</b>: The Wampanoags had several
other kinds of structures. Unfortunately, detailed
descriptions of these are for the most part nonexistent.</p>

<p>It is reported that the houses of chiefs were different
from the ordinary dwelling. They were larger,
and finer mats were used for their walls.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Note_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Also different
was the hunting house, which served as a base
of operations for the fall hunting season. It provided
shelter and a place to store the paraphernalia used in
hunting.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Note_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> Available data on construction tells only that
they were of a more temporary nature than the regular
dwelling house and that “barks and rushes” were used
in the building.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Note_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Another structure was the dance house,
built for ceremonial occasions. This was a longhouse
measuring as much as one or two hundred
feet.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Note_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>Other outbuildings in the settlement included:
watch houses in the corn fields, menstrual huts, and
sweat houses.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Note_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> Of these, there is some information
on the structural details of the sweat houses. They were
commonly constructed by excavating a cave into the
side of a hill. Sometimes an earth-covered extension
was built out from the side of the cave, forming a
structure that altogether measured about eight feet
in diameter and four feet in height. The door covering
was a blanket or a skin. The sweat house was placed
as near as possible to a stream or lake, so that the
bathers could plunge themselves into cold water at
the termination of the bath. Heat was provided by a pile
of stones heated on a fire.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Note_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="EQUIPMENT">EQUIPMENT AND MAINTENANCE<br>
OF BUILDINGS</h3>

<p>The furnishings of Wampanoag houses were
simple. This was necessary because of the Indians’
mobile life. All household equipment, including the
covering of the house itself, had to be carried from
camp to camp by the women of the household.</p>

<p>The interiors of houses were lined with bulrush
matting. This was decorated with painting or “embroidery”.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Note_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
Beds were family-sized—about six to
eight feet across.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Note_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> They were raised a foot to a
foot and a half off the ground.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Note_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> Forked sticks were
set into the ground to hold poles, across which planks
were laid.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Note_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> Rush mats served as the mattress, and the
sleepers covered themselves with skins, dressed with
the hair left on.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Note_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Such a bed served the entire family
and any visitors they might have.</p>

<p>The remainder of the furnishings consisted mainly
of the various containers used for storage, cooking,
and food service.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Note_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Cooking pots were sometimes made
of clay, but if possible iron, brass, or copper kettles
were obtained from the Europeans, since these were
not so easily broken.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Note_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Birch bark pails were used
as water containers, while various sizes of bags and
baskets served to store food.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Note_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> Carved wooden bowls,
plates, and spoons were also part of the furniture,
and some milling equipment probably occupied an
indoor place.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Note_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>Indoor fires were always kept burning.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Note_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> Fuel
was either what windfalls could be gathered or an
occasional larger tree which was cut and dragged in
to be fed into the fireplace by degrees.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Note_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> Over the
fireplace, which was a simple hearth made of field
stones, there was often a square frame of sticks,
supported on forked branches.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Note_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Pots were hung from
this framework. There was almost always a pot of boiling
food over the fire, or else there was meat suspended
on a stick whose end was buried in the ground.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Note_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
Drying fish or meat was also kept in the house at
times—to benefit from the fire when the weather
outside was damp. Bundles of rushes, bast fiber, hemp,
and the like for making mats and baskets probably
would have about completed the inventory of household
goods, save for personal possessions and tools.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Note_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<h3 id="SETTLEMENT">SETTLEMENT</h3>

<p>Descriptions of village layouts, locations and
sizes are virtually nonexistent. What information there
is, along with some suggested interpretations, is offered
as follows:</p>

<p>Both Champlain’s map and drawings of Wampanoag
houses at Plymouth harbor suggest that the
summer coastal settlements were laid out with each
family’s house (or in some cases, probably each wife’s
house) being located amid or beside its field.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Note_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> Average
field size was probably about one acre.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Note_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> Drawings
made by Champlain show fields fenced with parallel
poles placed upright in the manner of a low stockade.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Note_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>
It was in these summer villages that the Wampanoags
spent the most time during the year.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Note_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Actually, a
family might make one or two moves during the
summer, although staying in the same general area.
When the fields planted later in the season were too
far away for convenience, the family would move into
another house near the field they were currently cultivating.
Another resident of southern coastal New England,
the flea, sometimes prompted a shift in residence
during the summer. Fleas lived in the dust in the
houses, and when they became unbearable an Indian
family would move to a fresh dwelling.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Note_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>Reports of visitors to the southern New England
coast prior to the plague give the impression that
settlements of the “summer village” type were strung
out all along the coast.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Note_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Settlements apparently were
variable in size.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Note_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Writers who made this observation
may have been looking both at actual variation in
total group size and at seasonal variation in population
concentration and dispersal. The most concentrated
settlements were the winter villages.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Note_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> A longhouse
in one of the winter villages might shelter 40 or 50
people; there is no indication as to the number of
longhouses that might have been found in such a
village.<a id="FNanchor_323a" href="#Note_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>Fall hunting encampments were, like the summer
settlements, dispersed. Men moved onto the lands
to which they had the hunting rights. Since more land
was needed for hunting than farming, the spread of
dwellings would have been much thinner. As for the
spring fishing camps, it is known only that large
numbers of people gathered at them; sources give no
hint of settlement pattern.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="ENERGY">ENERGY AND POWER</h3>

<p>The principal source of light and heat for the
Wampanoags was the same fire over which they cooked
their meals. Additional light was sometimes provided
by torches. One variety was made of birch bark and
was used in night fishing.<a id="FNanchor_324a" href="#Note_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> Pine splints also served as
torches, used for lighting the interiors of houses.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Note_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>Both percussion and friction methods of fire-making
were used. For kindling fire by percussion the
Indian carried with him a small pouch containing the
proper materials for striking a light—a piece of
spongy dry wood for tinder and stones for producing
the spark. One stone was fastened onto the tinder
stick to more surely catch the spark when it fell.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Note_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>Aside from fire for heat, light, and cooking, and
occasional use of the sail, no naturally occurring
sources of energy and power were controlled by the
Wampanoags.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="COMMUNICATION">COMMUNICATION</h3>

<p>The Wampanoags did not use any mechanical
devices, such as whistles or drums for sending messages.
Instead, they used their voices to call out
information. When news had to be transmitted beyond
shouting distance, a messenger was sent. If he had
trouble locating his destination he would give a shout
when he thought himself a mile or so away, and
answering calls would guide him to the village he
sought.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Note_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>Since they had no system of writing, all information
that was to be passed on to other people, whether
news of the day or tribal tradition, had to be memorized.
To help in this task pre-literate societies sometimes
use mnemonic devices. The Wampanoag had
such a practice. Along the side of trails, near the place
where some event of historical significance had occurred,
they dug small holes, about a foot deep and
a foot wide to mark the spot. These were meticulously
re-excavated when they seemed to be filling in. As a
Wampanoag passed through his country the sight of
these markers reminded him of the stories they represented.
Thus reminded, he would tell them to
others.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Note_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="EXCHANGE">EXCHANGE</h3>

<p><b>Gift Giving</b>: Dances were held periodically, and at
these the dancers would dole out presents such as
wampum, to the spectators. Each man who was to
dance would take his turn at it, giving away his
possessions bit by bit until he had no more to give
and was exhausted from dancing.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Note_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>At the Nickomo feast, held in the winter, the
person giving the feast, besides providing food for
perhaps hundreds of people (the size of the guest list
depended upon what one could afford to pay for)
presented goods and money to his guests.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Note_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Upon
receipt of the gift, the guest would call out three times
an invocation for the prosperity of his host.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Note_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p><b>Trade</b>: The several groups of Indians of southeastern
New England traded among themselves in
pottery vessels, wooden bowls, bows, arrows, pipes,
shell money, stone bowls, skins, and food products of
the hunt and the fields.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Note_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> The manufacture of some
of these items appears to have been specialized according
to local group. That is, the women of one
locality seem to have made cooking pots, and these
were traded to the women of other groups.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Note_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Wooden
bowls seem to have been the specialty of the Wampanoags.
Soapstone pipes and bowls were produced
by the Narragansetts and were traded north at least
to Cape Cod.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Note_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> At a time that was probably early in
the seventeenth century the Narragansetts also took
over the production of wampum for the region. Craftsmen
spent the summer collecting suitable shells and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
the winter making the beads.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Note_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Trade in furs among
Indian groups was not highly developed prior to the
arrival of Europeans. It seems to have been mainly a
matter of trading for kinds of skins that were scarce
or finer than those in one’s own territory.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Note_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Food was
probably traded according to need. It was also traded
on the basis of geographical location, coastal tribes
exchanging with interior tribes.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Note_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>The arrival of Europeans in the New World provided
a great trade stimulus. The major trading interest
between Indians and Europeans was the fur trade.
Here coastal dwelling Indian groups such as the Wampanoags
took the advantage. Being first to meet the
Europeans, they quickly established themselves as
go-betweens in the trade, and besides doing trapping
of their own, they traded for the furs of inland tribes,
which they then traded to the Europeans for a profit.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Note_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
The fur trade caused increased emphasis upon hunting
and trapping. Since it was more profitable to trade
skins than to wear them, the fur trade was a force
that encouraged Indians to adopt European textiles
and dress.</p>

<p>The fur trade also was responsible for the introduction
of wampum into Wampanoag culture. Wampum,
used as money, was a trait belonging to Indian groups
to the south. Purple wampum may have first originated
on Long Island.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Note_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> When the Dutch settled New Netherland,
they found it a convenient medium of exchange
and adopted it. The regular use and production of
wampum found its way north to the Narragansetts,
but it did not become popular with the Wampanoags
until after 1627, the year in which the Dutch first
brought wampum to Plymouth and suggested its
virtues to the English settlers there.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Note_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Once its value
was appreciated, Indians of the Plymouth area began
to make it also.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Note_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Within the next twenty years, wampum
as ornament and money became ingrained in
Wampanoag culture.</p>

<p>Purple wampum was double the value of white.
Wampum was reckoned in value by count, 360 white
beads equalling a fathom, which was worth five shillings.
This number of beads might exceed or fall short
of a fathom in linear measure, but the number of beads
rather than actual length was the important criterion.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Note_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
The value of wampum, however, was based on the
market in furs.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Note_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> After 1648 this market dropped, and
after that date a 5-shilling “fathom” of wampum had to
consist of 480 white beads. In the period immediately
prior to King Philip’s War the use of wampum as
currency declined.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Note_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>Not all trade was in terms of skins and wampum.
These were basic but not the exclusive goods in
circulation. Guns and alcohol were popular items,
introduced onto the market chiefly by the French—much
to the distress of the English colonists and missionaries.
Corn was also much involved in New England
commerce.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Note_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Settlers traded corn with the Indians,
according to the needs of each in a particular year.
The Pilgrims at Plymouth traded corn to Indians in
Maine for furs, although this pattern came to be
replaced by an exchange of furs for wampum.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Note_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="LABOR">LABOR</h3>

<p>The basic division of labor was between the
sexes. Certain tasks were those of women; certain
others were those of men—neither did the work of
the other. Apparently there were also individual craft
specialty avocations, in terms of tribe or local group.
That is, besides doing all the tasks that were necessary
every day to produce food, clothing, and shelter,
some people also made bowls, pottery, pipes, etc. It
is not known, however, which people (i.e. a few individuals
or almost everyone) within the group made
these things.</p>

<p>The tasks of women centered about the home and
fields. Theirs was the job of building the house. They
set up the poles, made the mats to cover them, and
fastened on the covering. When the family moved they
took down the mats and carried them on their backs
to the next homesite, where they were put onto the
family dwelling in that place.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Note_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> The woman did all
the tending of the crops—she planted them, weeded
them, saw that they were guarded from birds, harvested
them, processed them, and stored them. She also made
the various containers in which they were stored.
Whichever of these products were to be carried to their
next camping spot she also carried.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Note_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>The various collecting activities were the woman’s
job—gathering shellfish for food and to bait her
husband’s line, collecting roots, berries, and seeds,
and also gathering the various raw materials needed
for making bags and baskets.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Note_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> When fish or game
was captured by the man of the house he left the
kill where it had fallen and sent his wife to fetch it in.
Having collected the game, the woman skinned it,
prepared the meat and dressed the hide, which she
might then make into clothing or some household
article.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Note_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Besides these things women had the job of
motherhood. Along with the household goods, the baby
rode on his mother’s back when the family moved.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Note_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
Women were valued as highly productive members of
the community. Bride-price is one institution that emphasizes
their importance. The more women there were
in a group, the more prosperous it was considered to
be. In war, female captives were prized. A wife who
wanted to leave her husband could run away to the
enemy and be welcomed.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Note_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>The business of men was to hunt for game, catch
fish, and provide protection for the weaker members
of the village.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Note_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Raising tobacco was an exclusive
activity of men. Men made and maintained their hunting
and war weapons. They also manufactured many of
the household tools and utensils.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Note_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Woodworking in
general was the province of men: they carved spoons
and dishes; they made canoes; they cut and shaped
the poles for houses; they cut down trees to make new
farm land; they constructed fortifications.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Note_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>Certain tasks were performed by groups of people
from the larger community. One of these was breaking
ground for spring planting, Williams writes that “All
the neighbours men and Women forty, fifty, a hundred
&amp;c., joyne, and come in to help freely”.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Note_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> Hunting by
drive, fishing of some kinds, and the building of
fortifications were also communal projects, as was
war.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Note_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>Children, as soon as they were old enough,
imitated the tasks of the similar-sexed parent. Toy
bows and arrows and miniature pots were among their
playthings. Children were useful for help in the fields
at such tasks as weeding and keeping away birds.
Men who were too old to hunt might also assist in the
agricultural activities, if they wanted to.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Note_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> Older women
whose families were grown no doubt helped take care
of toddlers so that mothers could do things outside the
house such as gardening.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="TRAVEL">TRAVEL AND TRANSPORT</h3>

<p>The Wampanoag had two means of travel available
to him—going on foot or by canoe. Likewise, for
the transport of his belongings and any trade goods
he could use his canoe or his back.</p>

<p>Travel on foot through the forests was difficult,
owing to the dense growth of bushes and low trees.
There were paths worn along regular routes, but
hunters had to traverse the woods. Early observers
reported that in order to ease movement through the
woods the Indians periodically set fire to the woods
and burned out the undergrowth.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Note_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>The Wampanoags were efficient about the business
of foot travel. They knew the country well and
crossed seemingly trackless woods with accuracy of
direction.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Note_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> They trained at running from early childhood
and a man could travel along all day at a jog-trot
with ease.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Note_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> The traveling costume was designed
for a minimum of encumbrance on the journey—the
normal dress being the breech clout. The traveler
carried a bag of parched corn meal for sustenance and
a pouch of tobacco, along with flints and pipe. He
either wore or carried his moccasins. A quiver of arrows
hung over his left shoulder, with the end resting
in his right hand. In the left hand the runner carried
his bow.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Note_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> A small quantity of corn sustained him
during the day, and by night he would seek shelter
among friends of another village, or if alone he would
kindle his own fire and dine on corn meal and water.</p>

<p>For water travel, either the birch bark or the
dugout canoe was used. The bark canoe was probably
preferred for travel on inland waterways, since portages
could be made with greater ease, owing its lesser
weight.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Note_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> Birch bark canoes were said to be difficult
to keep from capsizing. The Wampanoags, however,
were skilled in the use of these bark boats, and they
are described as venturing out in rough coastal waters.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Note_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
They were strong swimmers and quite prepared to
rescue themselves in case of mishap. The canoeist
knew how to right his craft while swimming alongside
and scramble in again.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Note_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> Canoes were usually propelled
by paddles.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Note_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> However, the occasional use of sails is
noted. A pole served for the mast and a skin robe or
two for canvas.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Note_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="RECREATION">RECREATION</h3>

<p>Recreation took two basic forms: sporting contests
and gambling. Both were spectator sports as well
as activities for the participants. The only team sport
was a game that the English observers dubbed
“football”. The ball was about the size of a handball.
The game was played on long sandy beaches, the goal
posts set a mile apart. If the rules followed the same
form as those in other areas of North America where
the game was played, the object was to get the ball
over the goal without using one’s hands. The game
might go on for two days before one goal was made,
in which case the spot of play was marked at the
end of the day and the game resumed there on the
following day. When one tribe played against another
the goal posts were hung with a great deal of wealth
in wampum and other goods to go to the team that
won. Players left their weapons in a common heap
before play began and painted their faces as for war.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Note_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>
Before the game, men from the opposing teams met
and shook hands. If the Wampanoag version of “football”
was comparable to that in other places where
the game was played, it was rough, and broken bones
were not uncommon. In the course of a game players
wrestled for possession of the ball and might be dunked
in the ocean. Despite the vigorous play, however,
tempers were seldom lost, and quarrels were rare.
Great multitudes of people gathered for these games;
women and children provided a noisy audience, calling
out praises to their favorite players. When the play
had ended, all joined for a great feast.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Note_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>Other sporting contests matched individual skills
in archery, swimming, and running. Again, the contestants
might be members of opposing tribes and
the match one of great public interest. Marksmanship
with bow and arrow was keen. The bowman held the
arrow between his thumb and forefinger. In one form
of shooting match the archer shot at his opponent, who
would try, usually with success, to dodge the arrows.
This was considered good practice for war.</p>

<p>European observers remarked that the Indians
were excellent swimmers. Their style was designed
for endurance, approximating what we would call a
side stroke.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Note_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> Children learned to swim while very
young. Like swimming, running was a matter of balancing
endurance against speed; the runner had to be
able to keep jogging along easily for a day or more.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Note_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>Gambling was less active but no less competitive.
Two types of gambling games were played. One, called
<em>Puim</em>, was played with 50 or 60 reeds, each about a
foot long. These were shuffled and dealt out to the
players in such a way that different numbers fell to
each; whoever had the most was counted ahead. A man
that was a skillful player at this game wore some of
the reeds through his ear as a challenge to anyone
who might like to try to beat him.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Note_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p>The other game was called <em>Hubbub</em>. It involved
placing five bone dice, painted black on one side and
white on the other, in a wooden platter, hitting the
platter hard on the ground to make the dice jump up,
and betting on the outcome of the color combination.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Note_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
When this game was a contest between communities,
a special arbor was built for the players who represented
each group. Four poles of 16 to 20 feet high
were set into the ground in a square to make this
structure, and it was draped with the large quantity
of wampum that was bet on the game. Hundreds of
spectators would be present at an inter-tribal contest,
described as having been a solemn affair. The spectators<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
would chant “Hub Hub Hub” as the dice were
being thrown, and the noise carried for a quarter of
a mile.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Note_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>Not all gambling was a great public spectacle.
It was a common activity of men at all times. It was
pursued with great diligence and for high stakes; a
group of men might sit for twenty-four hours without
interruption for sleep, drink or food, until all had
systematically gambled away the totality of their possessions—including
even their moccasins.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Note_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>Gamblers invoked supernatural good will, sometimes
by carrying a rock crystal charm. These were
thought to be pieces of thunderbolts.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Note_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> Gambling was
usually a serious undertaking. In most cases players
parted company in peace, however occasional disputes
arose which led to violence and might ultimately result
in killings.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Note_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="ENTERTAINMENT">ENTERTAINMENT</h3>

<p>Occasions for entertainment were usually activities
aimed at purposes other than mere diversion.
Songs, dances, and even public games had a ceremonial
cast to them. A close tie-in with magic and the
manipulation or propitiation of the supernatural is
suggested in most cases.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Note_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>At various times of the year great public gatherings
were held, in which the members of several local
groups met for feasting, dancing, and playing games.
At least two such public gatherings were held each
year. One was in the spring, when large numbers of
people had already congregated at certain fishing
places.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Note_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>The other time of general public congregation
was in the fall at harvest time. A dance house was
built for the occasion. Dances were held at night,
sometimes continuing for a week with the participants
sleeping during the daytime. Both men and women
gathered as spectators in the dance house; they sang
accompaniment while the dancers performed one at
a time. As he danced, the dancer would hand out
money, knives, clothing, and the like to the needier
members of the audience. When one dancer had given
all he had, another would follow him, and so on.</p>

<p>Besides the great public gatherings, there were
smaller private gatherings for various purposes.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Note_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> One
sort, to be discussed later, was to call for supernatural
aid. Another was the Nikomo feast, held in the winter
by members of a family for a select group of guests.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Note_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>
The host would give away as much of his wealth as
he could to those who attended the feasting and
dancing.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Note_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>Another favorite type of entertainment was story-telling
and oratory. People listened with rapt attention
to news and speeches. The discourse of one man might
go on for an hour or two, while a large audience
listened and smoked in silence; the manner of presentation
was dramatic and accompanied by a great
deal of gesture.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Note_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>The music which accompanied dances was provided
mainly by singing.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Note_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Sometimes dances were
accompanied by beating on the ground with sticks or
hands along with muttering, humming and singing, but
aside from these there were no musical instruments
among the Wampanoags.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Note_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>The dances themselves are described as being
“vehement in their motion”. At some dances a single
dancer would perform; at others a few men and women
would dance together.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Note_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Larger numbers of performers
participated simultaneously in war dances.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="PROPERTY">PROPERTY</h3>

<p>Adapted as they were to a mobile existence, the
Wampanoags did not own large numbers of personal
possessions judged by our standards. A typical list of
an individual’s possessions would probably include his
clothing, whatever tools he used from day to day, and
his “wealth” in the form of wampum, skins, and the
like. Even adding in such personal possessions as pipes
and jewelry, the amount of property in this class would
not have been large. At least some of this property was
buried with its owner at his death.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Note_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>Land and the right to use it was apparently owned
by the sachem. The boundaries of territory owned by
a particular sachem were well defined, and from this
land he allotted certain parts of it to his followers for
their use. Not much is known, however, of the basis of
land allotment.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Note_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>The sachem retained certain rights over the land
used by his followers. When a deer was shot in his
territory he was due the forequarters. He was also to
be given the skins of deer taken in water that was in
his territory. An annual tribute of food was given him
by all the people, in return for, among other things,
the use of his property.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Note_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="TERRITORIAL">TERRITORIAL ORGANIZATION</h3>

<p>In regard to the subdivision of Wampanoag territory,
Vaughan offers the following statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Anthropologists recognize nine subdivisions on the
mainland, an additional four on Martha’s Vineyard,
and several others scattered throughout
the offshore islands and coastal promontories.
The mainland sub-tribes were generally quite
cohesive, largely because of the strong leadership
offered by Massasoit and his immediate
heirs. The leading Wampanoag sachems kept their
principal headquarters at Pokanoket (now Bristol
Rhode Island)....<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Note_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The actual organization of the territory into political
units is difficult to discover from information
recorded during the seventeenth century. Ideally, there
would have been a sachem over each of the Wampanoag
subdivisions and under him various sub-sachems
who exercised some authority over more localized
areas.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Note_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> Probably, as the passage by Vaughan suggests,
true organization on a “tribal” basis was an
ephemeral thing.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Note_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>When a leader arose who could attract and hold
the loyalty of the various subdivisions of the Wampanoags,
then he came to exercise some authority
beyond whatever tract of land would have been considered
his “territory”—that is, the land which he
had the right to allot. Massasoit was such a leader.
He controlled a certain territory but also commanded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
the support of other sachems and received gifts from
them as tokens of their loyalty.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Note_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> The absolute authority
of a tribal leader like Massasoit was solid only as
long as he could keep his followers in agreement with
him, and dissension was not unexpected.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Note_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> Upon the
death of a sachem, there was probably considerable
shuffling and re-shuffling of territorial affiliation.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="GOVERNMENT">GOVERNMENT</h3>

<p>The chief Wampanoag official was known as the
sachem. The same official was also sometimes called
sagamore. The office was hereditary through the male
line—that is, a man’s son would normally succeed
him upon his death or retirement. There were some
variations upon this arrangement, and occasionally
wives, daughters, and nephews succeeded to the position
of leadership. If the heir was too young to undertake
the responsibility of leadership, the position was
usually held for him until he was of age. The arrangements
of regency in this event are not known. Usurpation
of the sachemship did occur, and if the man who
took the position away from the rightful heir could find
support and proved a good leader, he could retain
the position.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Note_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>The sachem oversaw the allotment of lands and
collected tribute from his followers. This tribute was
the source of his wealth. The more followers the
sachem could hold, the greater his wealth, therefore
people seeing his vast wealth would know he was a
powerful sachem. He took pains to please his followers,
since those who did not like his policies could leave
and join with another sachem.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Note_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> He provided for the
poor of his domain and gave presents to his followers.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Note_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>
Probably some of the feasts recounted by European
observers were given by sachems to express gratitude
to loyal followers.</p>

<p>Several special practices were associated with
the sachemship. The sachem might have several
wives. The first wife (who was the “official wife”)
had to be of chiefly descent. The sachem lived in a
house that was more elegant than those of his subjects.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Note_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>
When strangers came to the territory they were
lodged at the sachem’s residence. This allowed the
sachem to display his hospitality and also gave him
the opportunity to enquire into their business.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Note_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>A sachem made an annual tour of inspection of
his lands, visiting and talking with people and generally
evaluating the situation of his territory.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Note_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> A formal tribute
of corn was collected once a year, overseen by
officials who were designated as <em>pnieses</em>. The corn was
brought to a place near the residence of the sachem,
and the pnieses officially informed him of the gift.
He would then express gratitude verbally and by giving
gifts to his people.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Note_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>The sachem alone did not decide upon the policy
of the group. There were other individuals who had
a voice of authority in important matters.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Note_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> The
pnieses functioned as a tribal council, without whose
approval the sachem could not act in some cases.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Note_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>
In addition they were also war leaders and a personal
bodyguard for the sachem when he went abroad. Old
men were respected for their advice (which they
frequently dispensed in long formal orations) and were
consulted in decisions.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Note_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> Likewise, a powow whose
powers were respected and feared would have an influence
upon the governmental sphere of tribal activities.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Note_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>The governmental structure also included “sub-sachems”
with more local authority.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Note_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Their role was
mainly one of attending to the needs of their own
groups. Among their functions were the settling of
quarrels and acting as general intermediaries between
the local group and higher authority.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Note_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="LAW">LAW AND JUSTICE</h3>

<p>Among the Wampanoags, and likewise with other
primitive societies who lack full-time legal and judicial
specialists, the business of punishing wrongdoers and
settling disputes was often a matter of selecting the
most expedient course of action in the current situation.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Note_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>
For certain sorts of cases, however, there were
well-established patterns observed and recorded by
the seventeenth century chroniclers.</p>

<p>The chief judiciary was the sachem. He also
functioned as the jury, sometimes with the additional
counsel of other wise men, and in most cases he
carried out whatever punishment was decreed.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Note_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>
Regularly recognized crimes were robbery, adultery,
murder, and treason. For theft, the first offense resulted
in a degrading public rebuke. If the offender
stole a second time, he was beaten by the sachem
“with a cudgel on the naked back”. The third offense
resulted in a more severe beating, and he “... hath
his nose slit upwards, that thereby all men may both
know and shun him”.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Note_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>Adultery was punished by the wronged party, who
would beat the offender, sometimes to death—in
which case his death could not be revenged. The adulterous
wife was kept or sent away at the husband’s
wish. If the husband was the offender, his wife might
leave him, but there is no other form of punishment
recorded.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Note_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>Death was the punishment for murder. The
regular procedure was to bring the offender before
the sachem, who would pass judgement. The condemned
man was then blindfolded, compelled to kneel
and was bludgeoned to death by the sachem. Revenge
was eagerly sought by the kinsmen of a murdered man.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Note_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
They might take matters into their own hands and
seek out the offending party, especially if the formal
channels of justice did not first offer them satisfaction.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Note_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>
This was more likely to happen when the suspect
belonged to another tribe.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Note_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> If he were a valuable
man, his sachem might be reluctant to execute him.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Note_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>
In lieu of the actual offender, one of his close relatives
might be executed for the offense.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Note_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> It was also possible
to escape retribution by purchasing forgiveness
of the offended group of kinsmen if enough wampum
or other goods could be given.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Note_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>Treason also was usually punished by death.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Note_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
When the offender fled before his treachery was discovered,
the sachem sent special messengers with his
own knife to find and execute the guilty party. The
head and hands were brought back to the sachem as
proof of a mission accomplished.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Note_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> This procedure
was also used to dispatch suspected leaders of intrigues<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
against the sachem when it was feared that a
public execution might throw sentiment to the side
of the traitor’s faction.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Note_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>Etiquette required that all punishments, whether
beatings or death, were to be borne with a show of
outward calm. If one were to cry out, show pain, or
try to escape, it was considered to be an unspeakable
disgrace.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Note_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>Serious disputes that could not otherwise be
worked out might be settled by combat between the
two parties involved. In this case, each man was armed
with his bow and a quiver of arrows. They would cast
lots for a choice of the tree to use as a shield. From
behind their respective trees they would shoot at each
other until one or the other was killed. The scars of
wounds received in this kind of combat were displayed
with a great deal of pride.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Note_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>Inter-tribal justice, as the preceding suggests,
was of a dubious nature. If one tribe were wronged
by a member of another, emissaries were sent to ask
for compensation. Whether or not it was given was a
matter up to the tribe of the offender. Satisfaction
might involve taking the offender’s life or the payment
of a fine to compensate for loss through theft or killing.
If satisfactory reparations were not made the offended
party usually tried to forcibly take the equivalent in
lives or goods to what had been lost.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Note_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="SOCIAL_PROBLEMS">SOCIAL PROBLEMS</h3>

<p>Wampanoag society also had its problems of insanity,
widows, orphans, old people, and poverty.
Friends or relatives usually provided for those in need
of care. If they could not, however, it was up to the
sachem to see that the needy were sustained; it is said
that no one in the tribe went unprovided for.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Note_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="SOCIAL_STRATIFICATION">SOCIAL STRATIFICATION</h3>

<p>There were three basic divisions within Wampanoag
society: (1) the sachem and members of the
“royal family”; (2) ordinary members of the community;
(3) resident non-members (generally captives of
war) who acted as servants.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Note_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> However, within these
categories there was considerable difference in the
wealth and importance of members. There were also
statuses within the groupings that carried special
implications, such as warrior, powow, wife of sachem,
older man, etc.</p>

<p>There were certain visible signs of social standing
in Wampanoag society. The person of wealth or noble
birth wore zoomorphic tattoos on his face.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Note_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> His house
had mats of an especially fine quality.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Note_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> He wore a
lot of wampum and had it woven into caps and
aprons to show his lack of immediate need for this
money.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Note_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> He could have more than one wife.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Note_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> He
might have servants to do household tasks, and his
wife could have a nurse for the children.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Note_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="INTERPERSONAL">INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS</h3>

<p>English observers of the Wampanoags were impressed
with the hospitality the Indians showed toward
one another.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Note_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Any visitor was provided with a
share of whatever food the household had, even if
provisions were low.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Note_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> Regardless of when a guest
arrived, the courteous thing to do was to first offer
him food.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Note_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> The guest was provided with a place to
sleep—usually in the family bed. In the summer
the visitor might be provided with a space by having
a member of the household sleep outside.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Note_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>Hospitality can be linked to a basic cultural
pattern of value placed on, and presumably prestige
afforded by, generosity. The practice of giving away
goods in a public display of generosity was previously
discussed. By the same token, ingratitude was accounted
the worst breech of manners. Not only did the donor
thus lose his goods, but also the prestige of being
acclaimed a generous man if his sacrifice was not
noted by the proper thanks.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Note_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p>The Wampanoags’ hospitable attitude also extended
to the English, who were fed, sheltered, guided
through the woods, and advised of the movements of
strangers.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Note_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> It would have been a great discourtesy for
the English guests to have refused to join their Wampanoag
host for a meal, even though they found some
of the food un-palatable.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Note_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>Certain matters of protocol seem to have been
highly formalized. A greeting gesture was to stick the
tongue out as far as it would go and lick the hand
from wrist to finger tips.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Note_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>When a visitor came calling to discuss a serious
matter, the occasion began with solemn formality. He
entered the house and sat silently by the fire. Remaining
silent, he smoked a pipe of tobacco. Having
finished his pipe the visitor presented his host with
a gift. The host gratefully acknowledged the gift, and
then the visitor explained his business in the course
of a long speech.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Note_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="MARRIAGE">MARRIAGE AND FAMILY</h3>

<p>When a man wished to marry he spoke first to
the woman and then to her family. Permission of the
sachem was also necessary.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Note_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> The bride’s parents were
paid a sum of wampum or other goods to compensate
for the loss of their daughter, and the union was
solemnized by the sachem.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Note_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> A man might get help
from his relatives to pay the bride-price.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Note_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>If a woman felt that she was being ill-treated
or became displeased with her husband for some
other reason she would leave him.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Note_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> One way was
to run away and join whatever tribe her husband’s
group happened to be warring with at the time.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Note_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> When
a man wished to be rid of his wife, he sent her away
from him. Adultery was one reason for divorcing a
wife.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Note_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> A woman with the reputation of an adulteress
might not be able to find another man who would
marry her; such women sometimes became prostitutes.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Note_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>Wampanoags were polygynous. When a man took
additional wives, one, usually the first, remained as
the chief or principal wife with some degree of authority<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
over the other wives.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Note_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> In actual practice, not
many men had more than one wife at a time. Sachems,
powerful powows, and men of rank and wealth might
have additional wives; apparently not all of these
chose to do so.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Note_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p>There were two reasons given for having multiple
wives. First, an additional worker made a more productive
household.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Note_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> Second, a man might take an
additional wife after the birth of a child; sexual relations
between husband and wife were prohibited until
the infant was weaned, which might be a period of
more than a year.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Note_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>It was not common for anyone to live alone.
Single persons lived with their families, and widows,
widowers, or divorced persons usually also lived with
relatives until another marriage was made.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Note_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="REPRODUCTION">REPRODUCTION</h3>

<p>Expectant mothers did not vary their normal
routine of heavy work. Observers of the period noted
this practice and attributed to it the ease with which
women were able to deliver children. In the case of
a difficult birth, the services of the powow’s magic
were sought.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Note_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="INFANCY">INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD</h3>

<p>The few observations that were recorded suggest
that the Wampanoags had a high birth rate and rather
high infant mortality.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Note_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> The high number of infant
deaths may have been due in part to the fact that
within three days after its birth the baby was being
carried about on the mother’s back in all the tasks
that she went about outside.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Note_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> Moreover, the Wampanoag
style of cradle board made no provision for
a device to shield the infant’s face.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Note_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p>A baby’s clothing consisted of a coating of
grease and a beaver skin or other fur wrapping in
which he was bound onto the cradle board. The child
was tied so that his knees were drawn up against
his stomach, then when the board was set down and
leaned somewhere he would be in a sitting position.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Note_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

<p>Babies were soothed by the lullabies of their
mothers.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Note_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> It is said that they were generally very
quiet infants and cried little. The Wampanoags were
extremely fond of their children, giving them a great
deal of indulgence and affection.<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Note_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> Infants were not
weaned until they were over a year old.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Note_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> Such child-rearing
practices resulted in children that were
“sawcie, bold, and undutifull”, according to English
eyes.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Note_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="EDUCATION">EDUCATION</h3>

<p>Education was probably for the most part informal.
Children learned their adult roles by watching
adult activities and by being encouraged in their attempts
to copy. Such practical skills for survival as
swimming were taught at an early age.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Note_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> Little boys
played at shooting toy bows and arrows.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Note_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> Girls played
with miniature cooking pots, and they also participated
in the work of planting and tending the fields as soon
as they were old enough.<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Note_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>An education in the beliefs and values of the
Wampanoag people was gained in part by listening
to the stories told by parents and grandparents.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Note_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="INITIATION">INITIATION</h3>

<p>The transition of young Wampanoags into adult
status was marked by special observances. Boys and
girls both underwent initiation ceremonies; there is
almost no information of the nature of these observances
for females.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Note_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> For boys it was a lengthy process
to finally achieve recognition as an adult member of the
tribe. De Rasieres describes some of the aspects of
Wampanoag initiation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When there is a youth who begins to approach
manhood, he is taken by his father, uncle or
nearest friend, and is conducted blindfolded into
a wilderness, in order that he may not know the
way, and is left there by night or otherwise, with
a bow and arrows, and a hatchet and a knife. He
must support himself there a whole winter with
what the scanty earth furnishes at this season,
and by hunting. Towards the spring they come
again, and fetch him out of it, take him home and
feed him up again until May. He must then go
out again every morning with the person who is
ordered to take him in hand; he must go into
the forest to seek wild herbs and roots, which they
know to be the most poisonous and bitter; these
they bruise in water and press the juice out of
them, which he must drink, and immediately have
ready such herbs as will preserve him from death
or vomiting; and if he cannot retain it, he must
repeat the dose until he can support it and until
his constitution becomes accustomed to it so that
he can retain it.</p>

<p>Then he comes home, and is brought by the
men and women all singing and dancing, before
the Sackima; and if he has been able to stand
it all well, and if he is fat and sleek, a wife is
given to him.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Note_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Both boys and girls received new, adult names
at the time of their initiation.<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Note_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="MILITARY">MILITARY TECHNOLOGY</h3>

<p><b>Military Organization</b>: Although it is not known
for certain, it seems likely that the groups of men
called <em>pnieses</em> constituted an elite military society that
provided leadership in battles as well as being a
policy-making body. Boys with the proper characteristics—courage,
strength, stature, endurance, honesty,
discretion, and courtesy—were trained from
childhood to endure hardships in preparation for
becoming a pniese. When they were of the proper age
they were initiated into the society in a ceremony
which involved physical ordeal and supernatural experience.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Note_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>
Pnieses performed feats of great courage
and boldness and were considered to be immune to
wounds by enemy weapons. These were the leaders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
in battle—the men who carried long spears.<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Note_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p><b>Defensive Fortifications</b>: Winter villages were often
fortified against attack. Fortifications were pallisade
and ditch constructions. A pallisade consisted of upright
poles of some ten to twelve feet high, set into
the ground as close as possible. On the inside a
breast-high ditch was dug, and dirt thrown up against
the base of the uprights provided further protection
during combat. Spaces between the poles served as
loopholes. The fort had one or two entrances, depending
on its circumference. These were formed by overlapping
the ends of the wall.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Note_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>Forts varied considerably in size, and probably
there was also variation from the above structural
specifications. Sizes ranged from enclosures of about
fifty feet across to areas of several acres.<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Note_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> The smaller
fortified areas were probably meant for the use of
small groups when away from the main community,
perhaps during the hunting season. Thick woods and
swamps also served as refuge areas for women and
children in wartime.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Note_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

<p><b>Ordnance</b>: Weapons consisted of bows and
arrows, clubs, and tomahawks. Knives were used for
taking trophies. War leaders carried long spears. When
guns, swords and other European war machines had
been introduced into North America, these also were
used. Wampanoag fortifications were not so effective
against the guns as they had been against bows and
arrows.<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Note_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

<p><b>Uniform and Accoutrement</b>: The uniform of the
Wampanoag was his war paint, described in the following
passage: “When they goe to their warres, it
is their custome to paint their faces with diversitie of
Colours, some being all black as jet, some red, some
halfe red and halfe blacke, some blacke and white,
others spotted with divers kinds of colours....”<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Note_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>
In addition, wampum and other ornaments were worn
into battle.<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Note_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="WAR">WAR</h3>

<p>Motivations which could lead to war were revenge,
boundary disputes, and power struggles within
groups.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Note_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> The instigation for war might come from
the sachem or from some group among the people;
generally the agreement of the sachem and his council
was required before war could be undertaken.</p>

<p>Dancing and oratory were part of the preparations
for battle, serving to incite the warriors. The
following passage describes the pre-battle ritual:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There was one that kneeled upon a deer skin,
with the company around him in a ring, who
kneeled, striking upon the ground with their
hands and with sticks, and muttering or humming
with their mouths. Besides him who kneeled
in the ring there also stood one with a gun in
his hand. Then he on the deerskin made a speech,
and all manifested assent to it; and so they did
many times together. Then they bid him with a
gun go out of the ring, which he did; but when
he was out, they called again; but he seemed to
make a stand. Then they called the more earnestly,
till he turned again. Then they all sang.
Then they gave him two guns in each hand one.
And so he on the deerskin began again; and at
the end of every sentence in his speaking they
all assented, and humming or muttering with
their mouths and striking upon the ground with
their hands. Then they bid him with the two
guns go out of the ring again, but he made a
stand. So they called him with greater earnestness;
but he stood reeling and wavering as if he
knew not whether he should stand or fall, or
which way to go. Then they called him with exceeding
great vehemency, all of them, one and
another. After a little while he turned in, staggering
as he went, with his arms stretched out,
in each hand a gun. As soon as he came in, they
all sang and rejoiced exceedingly a while, and
then he upon the deerskin made another speech,
unto which they all assented in a rejoicing
manner....<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Note_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Wampanoags were skillful both in the use
of their weapons and in avoiding enemy fire. In the
woods, where most fighting seems to have been done,
warriors used trees for cover. In the open, bark shields
were used to ward off arrows, and the fighters were
skillful at dodging out of the way.<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Note_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> As a rule, when
a warrior had run out of arrows he left the battle.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Note_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>
As a result, mortality was not high, judged by the
standards of European wars of the period. In a large
battle, however, as many as twenty men might be
lost.<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Note_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

<p>The tactic of surprise was used whenever possible.
The occasion of a storm that would drive the enemy
indoors was a good opportunity for attack; warriors
could enter the village unnoticed and strike down the
foe in their houses before they could organize for
defense.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Note_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes battles took place on the water. One
reporter describes seeing thirty or forty canoes full
of men engaged in a pitched battle.<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Note_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>Warriors who were killed, or wounded so they
could not escape, had their heads, hands, and feet
hacked off and carried away as trophies.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Note_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> Scalping
was a practice that appeared late in the seventeenth
century; it may have been a European introduction.<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Note_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>
Most male captives faced a death by torture. Female
captives were kept alive; it is likely that they were
adopted into the tribe as wives or servants.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Note_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="IDEAS">IDEAS ABOUT NATURE AND MAN</h3>

<p>From childhood the Wampanoags learned to make
certain observations of the stars, planets, and of the
seasons and weather.<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Note_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> The time of day was measured
by the height of the sun in the day and by the moon
and stars at night.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Note_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> Longer spans of time were kept
account of in terms of the moon and of “summers”
and “winters”.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Note_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> Reckoning according to the moon,
they had thirteen months, each with its own name.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Note_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>
Many of the stars were named; the north star was
called <em>Maske</em>, meaning “bear”.<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Note_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> Winds were named
according to their direction; of these there were seven
to nine.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Note_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> By observing the winds and the sky the
Wampanoags made fairly accurate weather predictions.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Note_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>
<h3 id="SICKNESS">SICKNESS</h3>

<p>The Wampanoag practice of sweat bathing was
thought to have both therapeutic and preventive benefits.
First the sweat house was heated by putting a
great number of hot stones inside. Then the naked
bathers entered and the door was stopped up. The
bathers sat inside, smoking their pipes for as long
as they could bear the heat—perhaps an hour or
so. The sweat bath was then terminated by a dash
outside and a plunge into the cold water of a nearby
lake or stream. Sweat bathing was said to cleanse
and refresh the body and thus be good for general
health. It was also used to cure diseases, sometimes
in combination with other types of remedies.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Note_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>Herbal remedies were used for their therapeutic
effect on both diseases and wounds.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Note_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> The Wampanoags
are said to have had great skill in the use of
such remedies.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Note_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> The Wampanoag theory of herbal
remedies was that each symptom had a specific herbal
cure.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Note_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> For example, the cure for toothache was “... a
certaine root dried, not much unlike our ginger”.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Note_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
A different herb would be used to relieve stomach
aches, and so on.</p>

<p>Wounds and diseases were also cured by magical
means. Curing by magic seems to have been used in
cases where the suspected cause of the illness was
also magical. This malevolent magic was usually manifest
in the form of an “evil spirit” put into the ailing
person’s body to cause him pain. Healing by magic
was the special province of the <em>powow</em>.<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Note_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>

<p>When a person was quite ill, all his friends and
relatives would crowd into his wigwam and gather
around him. If someone could not be there in person,
he sent a representative.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Note_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> This audience joined in
the powow’s chanting at certain points during the
ritual.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Note_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> Wood gives the following description of magical
curing procedure:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... after violent expressions of many a hideous
bellowing and growning, he makes a stop, and
then all the auditors with one voice utter a short
Canto; which done, the Pow-wow still proceeds
in his invocations sometimes roaring like a Beare,
other times groaning like a dying horse, foaming
at the mouth like a chased boar, smiting on his
naked brest and thighs with such violence, as if
he were madde. Thus will hee continue sometimes
halfe a day, spending his lungs, sweating out his
fat, and tormenting his body in this diabolicall
worship....<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Note_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Next the powow would suck on the afflicted part of
the patient’s body and, being an expert at sleight of
hand, pretend to remove an object—a small stone,
or twig or the like—from the body and display it
for all to see. This object, it was claimed, was the
“evil spirit” that was the cause of the trouble. Sometimes
it was thought that the powow from some other
group had brought on the illness in the first place.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Note_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>Both men and women engaged in curing activities.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Note_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>
It may have been that there was a division
between the use of herbal and magical cures, with
magically caused illness and magical cures being the
province of male powows, and functional illness being
cured by specific herbal formulas which were non-magical
in their effect and which were the province
of women skilled in this art. This was true of some
other Northeastern Algonquian groups. Where such a
division occurred, there was little or no infringement
of one group on the methods that were the property
of the other. When symptoms did not respond to the
normal herbal treatment, or when they were recognized
to be supernatural in origin from the start, magical
cures were resorted to.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Note_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> Curers were paid well
for their efforts, and those who were successful became
wealthy and influential members of the
community.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Note_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p>If a patient recovered, his friends and relatives
would send corn and other sorts of gifts to him, and at
a certain time a feast (called <em>commoco</em>) would be held
in honor of the recovery.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Note_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> Sometimes in asking the
supernatural to remove a sickness it was necessary
to provide gifts as a sacrifice.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Note_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> This seems to have
been a practice resorted to in particularly grave situations.
In one instance, when several people had died
in an epidemic, the entire village gathered to perform
a curing ritual to drive out the sickness. The wealthier
people danced and gave away great quantities of
wealth to the poor; ultimately a messenger was sent to
intercede in person with the supernatural.<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Note_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> Epidemics
were greatly feared, and in the case of a known
contagious disease, the usual practice of friends and
relatives coming to visit the sick was not carried out.
In such instances often the entire village would be
abandoned.<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Note_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="DEATH">DEATH</h3>

<p>Death and the dead were greatly feared by the
Wampanoags.<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Note_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> Theories as to the causes of death are
little noted by the European chroniclers; there was,
however, the idea that the death of a child could
result from supernatural anger with the parent.<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Note_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>
After death the “good” were thought to go to the
southwest, where they would lead an idyllic existence.
Less fortunate people were doomed to wandering about
aimlessly.<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Note_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>Burial prepared the deceased for his journey to
the southwest. Hazards were expected along the way
(a large dog is one that is mentioned.)<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Note_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> For this
reason, and because the afterlife was expected to be
like earthly existence, the equipment of life—weapons,
wampum, ornaments, pots, and the like were buried
along with the dead.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Note_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> In the case of children, the
parents might make gifts of special ornaments and
treasures and put them into the grave.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Note_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p>One specially appointed person, “commonly some
wise, grave, and well-descented man” had the job of
preparing the corpse for burial and committing it to
the earth.<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Note_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> Woven mats were used to line the grave.
Boards might be placed in as lining for the grave of
an important person, likewise a greater wealth of
possessions and richer covering of mats indicated a
person of higher station.<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Note_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> The body was placed into
the grave in a sitting position—arms were drawn
across the chest and knees were bent up; it was
covered with a mat.<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Note_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> To mark an important grave a
skin mantle might be hung nearby and left there until
it rotted.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Note_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> It was also reported that monuments were
raised over the graves of great men, but there is no
indication of what these might have been.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Note_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>There was considerable mourning and display of
grief for the dead. Both men and women painted
their faces black to signify grief.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Note_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> Women would paint
their faces as soon as an illness appeared to be serious,
but men did not do so until death had occurred.<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Note_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>
At the moment of death the assembled spectators
would begin wailing and lamenting, men and women
alike.<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Note_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p>Adults were buried in or near the house, after
which all the mats were taken down from the house,
leaving only the frame remaining, and it was abandoned
forever.<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Note_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> The company of friends and relatives would
gather around the corpse as it lay at the grave’s edge
and lament copiously.<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Note_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> They would continue to mourn
thus for many days; the length of mourning increased
with the importance of the deceased. In the case of a
very important person, such as a sachem, the period
of mourning might last for a year.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Note_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> The black face
paint was worn throughout the period of mourning,
and it was often seen to be caked by tears.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Note_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> Upon
the death of a child, the father might cut off his proud
long hair and inflict wounds upon his body.<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Note_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> The anniversary
of the death was kept by a brief period of
renewed mourning, the face again being blackened.<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Note_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>
The name of a deceased person was not to be mentioned
again. If anyone living had a similar name, he
would change it.<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Note_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

<p>Concern was also shown for the family of the
deceased. Friends would often visit offering words of
consolation “... which they express by stroking the
cheeke and head of the father or mother, husband or
wife of the dead”.<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Note_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> Widows or widowers, left then
without a house, would take up residence with a related
family or perhaps move about among the homes of
their relatives for a time, where they were comforted.<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Note_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="RELIGIOUS_BELIEFS">RELIGIOUS BELIEFS<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></h3>

<p>The world of the Wampanoags was well-populated
with supernatural beings and forces. Of these, one
was a sort of generalized power, called <em>Manitou</em>.<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Note_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>
Many early observers of the Indians of northeastern
North America, where this concept is widespread,
developed the mistaken idea that “Manitou” referred
to an anthropomorphic supreme being. Actually, Manitou
is a force rather than a person. It could perhaps
best be likened to that force for good luck that many
Europeans think can be found in horse shoes, four-leaf
clovers, etc. thus, when a Wampanoag performed an
exceptional feat he was said to have Manitou, or
supernatural power. Likewise, certain objects, animals,
and physical features on the landscape were thought
to have Manitou in them, because someone had had
good luck right after seeing or touching them. This
could have happened so far in the past that it was
remembered only in mythology. Or, perhaps the whole
incident was a vision in a dream.<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Note_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>A related concept is something that can be called
animal spirits.<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Note_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> These were supernaturals in animal
form, who could interfere in the lives and fates of
human beings. Whether the power of these animals
was identical to Manitou is not known, and it is quite
possible that the relationship was not too clearly worked
out in the minds of the Indians either.</p>

<p>A great deal of emphasis was placed upon
dreams.<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Note_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> A Wampanoag who wanted supernatural
help could seek a dream in which one of the animal
spirits would appear to him and agree to help him,
often by becoming his guardian spirit.<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Note_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> He would then
call upon this supernatural helper throughout his life
for whatever aid its power enabled it to give. Crows
and rabbits in particular represented animal spirits,
and they were not supposed to be killed.<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Note_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></p>

<p>Powows also had animal spirits that they obtained
through dreams. Either the animal itself or the kind
of supernatural power that the animal had (it is not
possible to tell which from existing data) came to
dwell within the powow. He could then send this spirit
out to do his bidding.<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Note_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> Usually there were several
such animal spirits dwelling within one powow.<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Note_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>Also part of the supernatural world were the
ghosts of the dead. They lingered near the camps of
the living and caused trouble, often in the form of
illness.<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Note_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>The Wampanoags also had anthropomorphic
supernaturals. One of these was Kiehtan, a high god
who was responsible for the creation of the world and
all in it, and who could influence the prosperity of
the Wampanoags. He was called upon for plenty,
victory, and general favor in various undertakings.
His home was in the southwest, the place where spirits
of the good went upon death.<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Note_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> According to some
accounts this was also the place where other kinds of
spirits lived.<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Note_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<p>Another supernatural was Hobomock (Abamacho).
The Europeans immediately identified this being with
the Devil, because he had an association with snakes,
seemed to be able to cause harm to people, and was
often feared. Actually, he seems to have been capable
of both help and harm; his role in the supernatural
pantheon is not at all clear. Hobomock would actually
appear to the more important Wampanoags, taking
the form of an animal or bird, and most frequently a
snake. He was called upon in time of sickness to cure
people. One never dared to call upon Kiehtan in time
of illness for fear it might have been he in the first
place who sent the sickness as punishment. If the
illness was sent by Kiehtan, however, Hobomock could
not cure it.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Note_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<p>Mythology had it that people were made by
Kiehtan (Kautantowwit). He first made a man and a
woman out of stone, but, as he did not like them,
he broke them into many pieces and proceeded to make
another man and woman out of a tree. These he liked,
and their progeny populated the earth.<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Note_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> Corn and
beans were brought by the crow, who carried in one
ear a kernel of corn and in the other a bean, which
he had gotten from the field belonging to Kiehtan.<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Note_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p>The Wampanoags attributed a great deal of what
happened to them in their daily lives to supernatural
activity.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Note_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> Sometimes it was hard to determine at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
once whether a condition resulted from “natural” or
supernatural causes. A supernaturally caused illness,
for example, would often go unrecognized until conventional
herbal techniques proved of no avail in
bringing relief. Bad luck and accidents were usually
blamed on the supernatural.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Note_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> Winning at games was
considered to be done as a result of supernatural
aid, which was invoked throughout the period of play.
Bargaining, pleading, and threatening were all methods
used to bring supernatural favor upon one’s activities
and to dispel any unfavorable supernatural influences.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="RELIGIOUS_PRACTICES">RELIGIOUS PRACTICES</h3>

<p>In the event of war, drought, famine, and for some
cases of sickness, ceremonial activities which constituted
requests for supernatural aid were carried
out.<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Note_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> To beg for rain, people from all localities of the
tribe would gather at some high place and perform
supplications until the drought was broken.<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Note_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> Other
ceremonials were occasioned by a spirit of thanksgiving
for peace, health, plenty, and prosperity.<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Note_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<p>As nearly as can be told, ceremonial activity
encompassing all of the above circumstances involved
dancing and sacrifice of personal wealth to please the
supernatural. The sacrifice of wealth might take either
the form of gifts to the poor or actual destruction of
property by casting it upon the fire.<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Note_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> This latter custom
was carried out by the Narragansetts, and the
more a man brought to burn up, the more he was
esteemed. The Wampanoags said they did not cast
goods into the fire, but they acknowledged this to
be a powerful practice and attributed to it the Narragansetts’
salvation from the plague.<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Note_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> The seeking
of supernatural assistance was highly pragmatic; if
one supernatural source did not send the desired aid,
another was tried until the proper combination was
discovered.<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Note_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

<p>The Wampanoags placed a great deal of importance
upon dreams. A bad dream was considered to
be a threat from the supernatural, and a man awakening
from one would fall to offering prayers of supplication.
If the vision were especially ominous, a man
might call in his friends to keep watch with him. He
would offer them food, but he himself kept a fasting
and wakeful watch for several days and nights.<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Note_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p>

<p>Among the Wampanoags, names had supernatural
significance. “Obscure and mean persons amongst
them....” had no names.<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Note_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> Probably such persons
were resident non-members of the tribe and youngsters
who had not yet undergone initiation. Once received,
a name was a closely guarded piece of personal
property. It was considered discourteous to refer to
or call a person by his true name. Instead, a circumlocution
or a substitute pronoun was used.<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Note_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 id="ECCLESIASTICAL">ECCLESIASTICAL ORGANIZATION</h3>

<p>The Wampanoags only religious practitioner was
the powow. His role was that of intermediary between
the humans and the supernatural.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Note_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> When illness was
thought to be of supernatural origin he was called in
to determine the kind of force at work and to carry
out the proper ceremonies to restore health.<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Note_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> For this
work he received payment in advance. Should the
patient not recover, his relatives were apt to be angry
with the powow; they would demand the return of the
fee and perhaps his life if they felt that deception had
been involved.<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Note_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>Certain of the powow’s activities were deliberately
misleading. He often used tricks to help demonstrate
his command of supernatural powers. A powow was
said to be able to accomplish such feats as making
water burn, turning ashes into green leaves in the
winter, making ice appear upon water in the summer,
or turning himself into a “flaming man”. His skill at
sleight of hand aided in the working of some of these
wonders.<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Note_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<p>A man became a powow by having a dream in
which he was promised the type of supernatural power
that would make him a powerful religious practitioner.<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Note_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>
The man announced this dream to others on the
following day, and in the course of a two-day celebration
it was proclaimed that he was a powow.<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Note_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> The
success and competence of the new powow would be
judged by his future performance.</p>

<p><a id="Note_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> For an example of the Indians’ sentiment toward
the embrace of Christianity, the following passage
from Wood: “... since the English frequented those
parts, they daily fall from his the devil’s colours, relinquishing
their former fopperies, and acknowledge our
God to be supreame. They acknowledge the power of
the Englishmans God, as they call him, because they
could never yet have power by their conjurations to
damnifie the English either in body or goods; and besides,
they say hee is a good God that sends them so
many good things, so much good corne, so many
cattell, temperate raines, faire seasons, which they
likewise are the better for since the arrivall of the
English; the time and seasons being much altered
in seven or eight years, freer from lightning and
thunder, long droughts, suddaine and tempestuous
dashes of raine, and lamentable cold Winters.”; William

It is not really possible to tell which of these fish were
in most frequent use; bass seems to be the most
mentioned by writers on tribes in the area. Josselyn
lists the following as favorites of the Indians: striped
bass, sturgeon, salmon, eels and lamphreys and frostfish.

was writing about and since his home was to the north

<p><a id="Note_87" href="#FNanchor_87" class="label">[87]</a> Ibid. Early observers were impressed with the agricultural
skill of the Indians and characterized them as
being mainly dependent for their livelihood upon the
corn they grew. Speaking from a present-day vantage
point, with considerably more information at hand
about the practices of primitive horticulturalists, one
must be more cautious about drawing such a conclusion.
In regard to the amount of corn produced, Williams
says: “The woman of the family will commonly
raise two or three heaps of twelve, fifteene, or twentie
bushells a heap ... and if she have the helpe of her
children or friends, much more.” (p. 124). Presumably
the size of the fields on which this was grown averaged
out to about an acre per family. The Pilgrims were able
to get corn from the Indians in order to survive their
initial hardships. Later they tell of obtaining rather
large amounts of corn from the Indians along the coast
to take north to trade (Willoughby, pp. 297-98). However,
before assuming that agriculture was the major
food source for the Wampanoags, it should be remembered
that these Indians and their neighbors were best
known to the early chroniclers in their coastal farming
settlements. When they were living in the forest during
hunting season and in the winter villages they were probably
seldom seen by the Europeans. Therefore, the
foreigner’s view of Indian dietary habits may not
contain the entire story. The habitual use of acorns
and ground nuts as starvation foods indicates that
their control of agricultural food supplies was not
as yet always dependable. Probably horticulture had
come to largely supplant a pattern of summer gathering
of vegetable foods and to be ordinarily more
productive than the former practice. But without the
addition of animal foods, the crops alone probably
would not normally have provided enough food to
sustain the Indians.</p>

<p><a id="Note_175" href="#FNanchor_175" class="label">[175]</a> Willoughby, p. 151, illustrates one basket, dating
about 1675 and made by the Narragansetts. It is a
twined basket; the materials are basswood bark and
corn husk, the decoration being in the latter. Red
wool yarn also once was part of the decoration, but
that has been since destroyed. Designs are worked in
light corn husk, which forms part of the weft element.
Design form is geometric, non-representational, diagonal
steps, horizontal bands, and disconnected square
spots. Design field covers the entire side area of the
basket, which is tall and narrow in shape. Recalling
Gookin’s description of zoomorphic decoration, there
is reason to suspect considerable scope to the decorative
content of this style.</p>

Philip’s belts, ‘curiously wrought with black and white
wampum in various figures and flowers and pictures
of many birds and beasts’ was nine inches broad, and
when hung about Captain Church’s shoulders reached
to his ankles. Philip had two other belts, one with
two flags upon the back which hung from his head,
the other with a star upon the end which hung from
his breast. When Philip visited Boston he wore a coat
and leggings, set with wampum ‘in pleasant wild

<p><a id="Note_322" href="#FNanchor_322" class="label">[322]</a> When Plimoth Plantation was established there
were no Indians settlements in its immediate neighborhood.
The former village of Patuxet, once located on
the site of Plymouth and said to have had a population
of two thousand, was wiped out by the plague prior
to the settlement of Europeans. Altham, p. 29, reports
that the nearest Indian settlement to Plymouth was called
Manomet and was fourteen miles away. This is
probably identical with the town of Mannamit, described
by Chase as being in Sandwich, near the bottom
of Buzzard’s Bay; H. E. Chase, “Notes on the
Wampanoag Indians,” SMITHSONIAN ANNUAL REPORT,
1883 (Washington, 1885), p. 888.</p>

<p><a id="Note_323" href="#FNanchor_323" class="label">[323]</a> If, as reports indicate, twelve to twenty men went
out from each summer village in the fall to their hunting
camps, and it may be assumed that these represent
most of all the able-bodied adult male population,
then we would seem to be dealing with summer
village populations whose total numbers would equal
in size the population of a winter longhouse. It might
further be surmised that the personnel of each are
identical; in other words, the same group of 40 to 50
people may have formed a camping-together unit
for most of the year, living together in the same longhouse
in winter and camping near each other as a
summer village.</p>

that there were both male and female powows and

Williams states that the powows administered nothing

actions used by the powow is there any mention of
the use of herbal cures as part of the process.</p>

philosophy may reflect the bias of European
observers conditioned by their own Christian beliefs
and the desire to see parallels to them. In actual fact,
Wampanoags seem to have had a concept of multiple
souls, and the fate of all these was perhaps not the
same, considering the fear they had of spirits of all
the dead.</p>

of this display was less of what we would call
“grief” than an attempt to convince the spirit of the
deceased not to linger and trouble those who were
close to him in life. Malevolence on the part of spirits
of the dead is a typical northern Algonquian pattern,
and abandoning the house to trick the spirit of a dead
relative is a very common practice in primitive groups
throughout the world.</p>

a common tale in North American Indian mythology
involves the existence of the world in some other state,
its destruction and subsequent transformation into its

has been altered through contact with Christian

varied in its nature from one powow to another, depending
upon the kind of spirit which gave it, thus
the abilities of powows would vary accordingly as to
what sorts of things they were able to do. This in turn
was displayed in various individualized types of tricks.</p>

the role of the powow was not formally hereditary. In

to certain families, if only because association and
heredity stimulated the appropriate dreams in the
offspring of those who were powows.</p>
